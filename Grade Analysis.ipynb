Like is this the average GPA of the classes that contribute to your major(my fundamental chem, math, CS, and Electrical Engineering classes) or is it only my \"major-specific\" classes (only electrical engineering classes)?I am asking this because some of the fundamental circuit classes are kind of screwing me over GPA-wise, but my math grades are great and I hope to do research in areas that require many math classes (like either control systems or signal processing). Thanks!",

Each of our “meetings” must be done in person and not over Zoom (yay for a state with essentially no mask mandates and low vaccination rates) and one student is expected to take “minuets” which are submitted with our assignments. For bonus points, our notes are graded too. I swear I graduated high school almost a decade ago, but I guess not.
