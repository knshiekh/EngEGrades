"Here's a summary of the post in a few sentences:

The student had a tough semester where they struggled with grades, dropping one class and barely failing another by only 1 point. To make matters worse, their final grade for an 4-hour class was miscalculated and turned out to be a C instead of a B. As a result, the student is now on academic probation and faces additional requirements next semester, including completing an online module or participating in research or a workshop, which they feel is unfair."
"It seems like this current student is experiencing some frustration or impatience, but it's not clear what they're waiting for. Based on their interest in engineering and their current enrollment in the program, I'm guessing they might be waiting to hear back about course registration, internship opportunities, or even just a resolution to a personal issue affecting their academic progress."

"Here is a summary of the post:

As a current freshman in a rigorous college engineering program, I'm feeling stuck because I was expecting it to be easier to switch to liberal arts later on. However, with a scholarship to continue studying engineering, I feel pressured to succeed despite not being passionate about it. My grades are suffering and I'm considering retaking my calculus 1 course - I'd love advice on how to study for the rigor of engineering and find success in this field even if I don't have strong passion for it."
"Here's a summary of the post in a few sentences:

A prospective mechanical engineering student at UCONN is starting college in the spring after having had poor mental health issues during his high school year. He feels left behind and lonely, knowing that his classmates are already taking advanced classes like calculus 2 while he's stuck in calc 1. He's concerned about being behind in his studies and asks for advice on how to recover and catch up with his peers."
"Here's a summary of the post:

The author is an engineering student who has struggled with grades, having received two D's and some C's so far. They're eager to improve their performance but feel that networking skills are just as important in their field. The author would appreciate chatting with other students taking physics 2 or differential equations classes."
"Here's a summary of the post in a few sentences:

The student is struggling with an engineering class and needs to get an extremely high grade on the final exam to pass, which seems unlikely. They're considering skipping the exam and accepting a failing grade, but also want to hold onto hope that they can still pass. On top of this, they're recovering from Covid and feeling guilty for taking it easy."
"This is a comprehensive guide for engineering students, specifically focusing on effective study habits and strategies for success in their classes. The author provides an unconventional approach to studying, emphasizing the importance of creating a ""Personal Reference Library"" (PRL) that serves as a central repository for all course materials, notes, and solutions.

Here are some key takeaways from the guide:

1.  **Create a Personal Reference Library**: This is the core concept of the guide. A PRL should contain:
    *   Deconstructed methods, derivations, and word definitions
    *   A huge database of practice problems and their solutions
    *   A plan of attack for encountering new materials and problems

2.  **Preparation is Key**: The author stresses that preparation begins early in the semester. This involves understanding course materials, practicing problems regularly, and using office hours to clarify doubts.

3.  **Retain Information Through Repetition**: Learning is an active process that requires repetition for retention. The guide recommends doing practice problems multiple times over several days to reinforce learning.

4.  **Use a Plan of Attack**: When encountering difficult new problems or materials, refer to your plan of attack. This can be thought of as a ""troubleshooting guide"" for math problems, helping you navigate common forms and substitutions.

5.  **Make the Most of Your Time**: Allocate time effectively by identifying when exams are, understanding what chapters are covered, and knowing how to approach the exam with confidence.

6.  **Create a Cheat Sheet**: As the semester progresses, compile information from your PRL into a cheat sheet that can be used as a quick reference guide during practice exams or actual exams.

7.  **Teach Others**: One of the most effective ways to reinforce learning is by teaching others. This can be done through study groups or by simply explaining concepts to a friend.

8.  **Maximize Your Grade**: The author provides some surprising statistics on how students with good grades often employ certain habits, such as maintaining a PRL and studying regularly.

The guide concludes by emphasizing the importance of self-discipline and time management in achieving academic success."
"Here's a summary of the post in a few sentences:

The author, an Electrical Engineering student, shared their experience of taking 3.5 years (including a year they mostly ""fucked around"" without a clear major) to complete their first year in college due to poor grades and struggling with certain concepts. They're now facing a potential 9-year journey to finish a 4-year degree. The author is concerned about their future prospects for internships and job opportunities, and asks if anyone has been in a similar situation and how they managed to pass."
