I am a bit confused on the GPA requirements for a masters/PhD program. I've heard that these schools look for both overall and technical GPA. What is technical GPA? Like is this the average GPA of the classes that contribute to your major(my fundamental chem, math, CS, and Electrical Engineering classes) or is it only my ""major-specific"" classes (only electrical engineering classes)?I am asking this because some of the fundamental circuit classes are kind of screwing me over GPA-wise, but my math grades are great and I hope to do research in areas that require many math classes (like either control systems or signal processing).

Unfortunately, after receiving a non passing grade for a prerequisite, I am unable to move on to the next class and fulfill my requirements for my degree. I feel like such a failure. I truly cannot wrap my head around the class and I know it takes a lot of time to get the material down. I'm mostly afraid of telling the company that has hired me that my time at school might be extended, which may cause them to retract the offer from me. To think that this is all caused by one class makes me all the more frustrated in myself. At this point I feel like giving up on it completely. If anyone has any advice at all, I would love to hear it."

After 6.5 years I graduated and just accepted a full time job. Crying with joy,"I had no idea how much joy and relief I would feel when I finally graduated and got a job. After living in poverty, constantly worrying about rent, crashing on friends couches, and working myself to death for the last 6 and a half years, I'm finally done and now I'm crying and yelling and laughing with joy. If anyone reading this is struggling with school, life, money, depression: just keep pushing. School sucks and it makes life suck. But please keep pushing! You can do this! Engineering school takes as long as it takes, and if you need to take breaks for work, mental health, or any reason, do it. If you want to know my story, read on: TLDR at the bottomMy parents made it clear to me early on that if I wanted to go to college, I'd have to pay for it myself. I got accepted into two engineering schools and made the very stupid decision to go to the one the didn't offer me a scholarship. It was more prestigious and one of the best engineering schools in the US, so I figured the degree would pay for itself in the long run. I knew I would have to work hard to pay for it, but I expected to be able to get student loans. As it turns out, an 18 year old right out of high school doesn't have enough credit history to qualify for any kind of student loan. I paid for my first semester with my summer earnings from working at Subway during the mornings and selling chopped firewood in the evenings. I still didn't have enough, so I took a job selling knives. (I wasn't that successful but I did manage to win myself a 12 piece set of very nice knives!)When I left finished my first semester I was told if I didn't finish paying my bill they wouldn't let me move back into the dorms after winter break. I spent nearly every day that winter break waking up at 5 to spend the entire day cutting, splitting, and delivering firewood. I had family members, friends, and random acquaintances volunteer to help me so I could earn enough. I didn't ask anyone for help, but I never would have graduated without them donating their time and energy to my goal. After my freshman year of college I spent 1.5 years working as a waiter and private tutor. Eventually the private tutoring was successful enough that I could quit the waiter job and focus on finding new clients to tutor. I got really good at learning new subjects quickly so I could teach more people. The skills I learned tutoring directly contributed to my success at school. I never would have graduated without those skills, or without so many students that allowed me to help them over the years. After 1.5 years of working, I returned to school with renewed determination. I took 18+ credits each semester, managed my best grades of my college career, and kept 6-8 weekly tutoring clients happy. The hardest times were, and this won't surprise you, finals weeks. My studying time was spent helping my students study. My finals week stress was amplified by my student's finals week stress. But I never would have graduated if I didn't taken every tutoring opportunity I had, even if it meant sacrificing my own grades. Earning more money had to come first, because I REALLY didn't want to stop going to school again. During this grind, I got really depressed. I didn't find joy in tutoring anymore because it reminded me too much of school. School (and work, but mostly school) had sucked away my passion for everything. I had no hobbies because I never had energy to do anything. I skipped meals once or twice a day because I didn't have enough time or money or energy to cook. During my junior year I finally had enough. I spontaneously bought a climbing gym membership because I had gone once before and thought it might be something I could enjoy. I was right. Climbing saved my sanity. I got a lot stronger and more attractive, which gave me a lot of confidence. I never would have graduated if I hadn't found a reason to enjoy living. You can't go through engineering school without taking some time for yourself, no matter the cost. COVID hit my senior year. Being able to attend class from home and catch up on missed assignments during the initial shutdown was great. But after a while virtual classes really wore down my motivation. I pushed my way through senior design and it looked like I was finally on the home stretch. Two weeks before I thought I would graduate, I found out that the Engineering Economics class I was in didn't qualify for a specific social sciences credit I needed. Literally ANY other economics course would have qualified. I was defeated. I barely did anything for 3 weeks. That was December 2020. I only needed one class, but I was completely broke and was being forced to move out of my apartment. One of my good friends and climbing partners let me stay on the floor of his living room in his one bedroom apartment. (He didn't own a couch). We ended up building a loft on top of his home climbing wall so I could have a bed and a tiny tiny amount of personal space. I never would have graduated without him giving me everything he had to offer. I'm truly grateful for this friend. After 8 months of living like this I had finally earned enough to move out and start my final semester. I only needed one class to get my bachelors in mechanical engineering but I realized I could also get a minor in computer science with an additional class. My final semester should have been easy with only two classes, but I was so burnt out that I fought hard for the 2 Cs I earned. I finally graduated last month.Today I accepted a full time position at a waste water construction consulting company. It's very small, there will only be two other engineers besides me, one of which is my boss. Speaking of my boss, I've been doing contracting handyman work for him for the last six months. I love working for him and he's very fair and compassionate. The pay is decent, benefits are great. For some reason I'm most excited about the 2 new pairs of work boots the company is buying me. It's been along time since I bought shoes for myself.Thanks for reading my story if you got all the way down here. I don't remember a time I felt as stress free as I do now. I've been yelling and crying for 2 hours because I'm finally through the grind. If I learned one thing it's that you need to put your mental health first to survive in the long run. If anybody is going through hard times and needs some extra motivation to keep pushing, message me anytime. TLDR: Worked full time during school and still had to take breaks to earn money to survive.

After living in poverty, constantly worrying about rent, crashing on friends couches, and working myself to death for the last 6 and a half years, I'm finally done and now I'm crying and yelling and laughing with joy. If anyone reading this is struggling with school, life, money, depression: just keep pushing. School sucks and it makes life suck. But please keep pushing! You can do this! Engineering school takes as long as it takes, and if you need to take breaks for work, mental health, or any reason, do it. If you want to know my story, read on: TLDR at the bottomMy parents made it clear to me early on that if I wanted to go to college, I'd have to pay for it myself. I got accepted into two engineering schools and made the very stupid decision to go to the one the didn't offer me a scholarship. It was more prestigious and one of the best engineering schools in the US, so I figured the degree would pay for itself in the long run. I knew I would have to work hard to pay for it, but I expected to be able to get student loans. As it turns out, an 18 year old right out of high school doesn't have enough credit history to qualify for any kind of student loan. I paid for my first semester with my summer earnings from working at Subway during the mornings and selling chopped firewood in the evenings. I still didn't have enough, so I took a job selling knives. (I wasn't that successful but I did manage to win myself a 12 piece set of very nice knives!)When I left finished my first semester I was told if I didn't finish paying my bill they wouldn't let me move back into the dorms after winter break. I spent nearly every day that winter break waking up at 5 to spend the entire day cutting, splitting, and delivering firewood. I had family members, friends, and random acquaintances volunteer to help me so I could earn enough. I didn't ask anyone for help, but I never would have graduated without them donating their time and energy to my goal. After my freshman year of college I spent 1.5 years working as a waiter and private tutor. Eventually the private tutoring was successful enough that I could quit the waiter job and focus on finding new clients to tutor. I got really good at learning new subjects quickly so I could teach more people. The skills I learned tutoring directly contributed to my success at school. I never would have graduated without those skills, or without so many students that allowed me to help them over the years. After 1.5 years of working, I returned to school with renewed determination. I took 18+ credits each semester, managed my best grades of my college career, and kept 6-8 weekly tutoring clients happy. The hardest times were, and this won't surprise you, finals weeks. My studying time was spent helping my students study. My finals week stress was amplified by my student's finals week stress. But I never would have graduated if I didn't taken every tutoring opportunity I had, even if it meant sacrificing my own grades. Earning more money had to come first, because I REALLY didn't want to stop going to school again. During this grind, I got really depressed. I didn't find joy in tutoring anymore because it reminded me too much of school. School (and work, but mostly school) had sucked away my passion for everything. I had no hobbies because I never had energy to do anything. I skipped meals once or twice a day because I didn't have enough time or money or energy to cook. During my junior year I finally had enough. I spontaneously bought a climbing gym membership because I had gone once before and thought it might be something I could enjoy. I was right. Climbing saved my sanity. I got a lot stronger and more attractive, which gave me a lot of confidence. I never would have graduated if I hadn't found a reason to enjoy living. You can't go through engineering school without taking some time for yourself, no matter the cost. COVID hit my senior year. Being able to attend class from home and catch up on missed assignments during the initial shutdown was great. But after a while virtual classes really wore down my motivation. I pushed my way through senior design and it looked like I was finally on the home stretch. Two weeks before I thought I would graduate, I found out that the Engineering Economics class I was in didn't qualify for a specific social sciences credit I needed. Literally ANY other economics course would have qualified. I was defeated. I barely did anything for 3 weeks. That was December 2020. I only needed one class, but I was completely broke and was being forced to move out of my apartment. One of my good friends and climbing partners let me stay on the floor of his living room in his one bedroom apartment. (He didn't own a couch). We ended up building a loft on top of his home climbing wall so I could have a bed and a tiny tiny amount of personal space. I never would have graduated without him giving me everything he had to offer. I'm truly grateful for this friend. After 8 months of living like this I had finally earned enough to move out and start my final semester. I only needed one class to get my bachelors in mechanical engineering but I realized I could also get a minor in computer science with an additional class. My final semester should have been easy with only two classes, but I was so burnt out that I fought hard for the 2 Cs I earned. I finally graduated last month.Today I accepted a full time position at a waste water construction consulting company. It's very small, there will only be two other engineers besides me, one of which is my boss. Speaking of my boss, I've been doing contracting handyman work for him for the last six months. I love working for him and he's very fair and compassionate. The pay is decent, benefits are great. For some reason I'm most excited about the 2 new pairs of work boots the company is buying me. It's been along time since I bought shoes for myself.Thanks for reading my story if you got all the way down here. I don't remember a time I felt as stress free as I do now. I've been yelling and crying for 2 hours because I'm finally through the grind. If I learned one thing it's that you need to put your mental health first to survive in the long run. If anybody is going through hard times and needs some extra motivation to keep pushing, message me anytime. TLDR: Worked full time during school and still had to take breaks to earn money to survive. Graduated last month in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in computer science. I just accepted a full time engineering position and now I'm crying for the first time in years."

The start of the semester wasn't great because I figured out I have to stay at school another semester there for 1 class. So that has been really hard todigest because I was looking forward to graduating. That's okay though because it gives me a little more time to complete my degree. I am working on just accepting this because I have alot to do this semester. For the past couple years I have been dealing with depression and ADHD. I am glad I have a lot of help from my school mental health center and the disability center. I see my psychiatrist every month and started my anti depressants again. I also see a coach at the disability center ever week. Last semester I was suspended from my department and was not allowed to enroll in classes anymore. I failed many courses but I got relief from the mental health center which basically wiped off my bad grades. I am super thankful for this, however I was still suspended. I appealed my suspension after the relief was approved, however my department's policy for suspension appeals is that you must get a 3.0 gpa in that semester or you will get kicked out with no possibility of getting back in. I am enrolled in 15 credits right now.This all feels like a nightmare to me and it doesn't feel real. For all this time I think my depression has not allowed all of this to hit me and truly change my study habits and knock out of this funk. I am terrified every day that I will fuck this chance up and won't graduate and waste all my parents money. This thought comes into my head like a rush of panic and I just live in a lot of stress. I have kept up decently these first 3 weeks but I am so afraid I will begin to fuck up. I really can't mess this up. I don't want to lose motivation or burnout or procrastinate or fall in the bad cycle that I do every semester. I live in fear every day and it's really hard to stay calm and keep pushing myself. If anyone has advice, please help me. This is the time where I need to start getting on top of all my assignments and going to office hours but I need some way to relieve this anxiety and stress too. I feel nauseas and can't sleep well and my hands have a tremor bc of my anxiety but it's been alot worse these past few weeks. Like my hands literally just vibrate on their own when I hold them up. I don't want to burn my body out with carrying all this stress and don't know what to do. I know I should probably go to the gym or exercise to relieve myself but I'm scared I won't make enough time to do my work and then I'll get behind. There has not been a single semester where I didn't get behind atleast 2 weeks of material (but many more for the past few semesters). I feel trapped in my own little hell and am scared of what will happen if I can't escape. Please give me advice if you have any, thank you. Also I have an appointment with my therapist next week however the schools mental health center is very busy and they only have time to see me once a month.

If it helps, I am in southern CA, but the thing is, I have no idea how extracurriculars work because I've always just been focused on grades. I am sorry for any dumb question I may reply with. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I have been taking Spanish courses since my freshman year for a Spanish minor for my passion of learning it and to build off of my skills from high school in hopes of possibly using it in industry (although I want to get into aerospace where I am sure that English is used 99.9% of the time, and my minor may not be of use). So far, I have invested 12 credit hours into it, and I need 18 hours to complete it.To complete my minor, this semester, I signed up for 2 asynchronous classes (6 hours) with the same professor since the in-person offerings were at unusually inconvenient times on top of my final 9 engineering hours. My previous Spanish courses have been quite enjoyable; I learned a lot through conversation and well-designed assignments, and the workload was considerably less than my engineering courses. However, these 2 classes have been tremendously more time consuming and unhelpful for my learning as the professor has structured the courses to include lengthy readings, frequent essays, and other random/purposeless assignments. Although I was expecting to not learn as much given the asynchronous style, I was not anticipating this much work at all. In fact, although the professor grades leniently, these classes are still taking up slightly time more than my engineering courses on a per-hour basis.As a result, the past few weeks have been utter hell with these classes, engineering classes, and extracurriculars, and my life balance that I have been working on perfecting throughout college has quickly deteriorated. Entering the semester, I wanted to take a step back and spend time on myself and this balance — something I thought would be entirely possible with needing to take less engineering classes, more Spanish courses — but this has been nowhere near feasible, and I have started to consider dropping both Spanish courses and just finishing my major. I am noticeably more busy now than I ever have been in all of school, and I am shocked that I have not completely burned out yet this semester. However, pondering this devastates me since Spanish has become one of one of my traits, and I have always seen myself throughout college graduating in 4 years with my major and minor.In conclusion, I have spent so much time attempting this Spanish minor and I feel like I am letting my past and maybe future self down by dropping it when I am so close, but my present self really doesn't want to spend the rest of my semester on this ridiculous grind. This is the most impactful decision I've come to in college, and I'm having difficulty coming to terms with either outcome. I would hate to end up regretting dropping my minor. Has anybody else been in a similar situation with advice to share? Thanks!","Title: Dropping a language minor half a semester from completing it.

So far, I have invested 12 credit hours into it, and I need 18 hours to complete it.To complete my minor, this semester, I signed up for 2 asynchronous classes (6 hours) with the same professor since the in-person offerings were at unusually inconvenient times on top of my final 9 engineering hours. My previous Spanish courses have been quite enjoyable; I learned a lot through conversation and well-designed assignments, and the workload was considerably less than my engineering courses. However, these 2 classes have been tremendously more time consuming and unhelpful for my learning as the professor has structured the courses to include lengthy readings, frequent essays, and other random/purposeless assignments. Although I was expecting to not learn as much given the asynchronous style, I was not anticipating this much work at all. In fact, although the professor grades leniently, these classes are still taking up slightly time more than my engineering courses on a per-hour basis.As a result, the past few weeks have been utter hell with these classes, engineering classes, and extracurriculars, and my life balance that I have been working on perfecting throughout college has quickly deteriorated. Entering the semester, I wanted to take a step back and spend time on myself and this balance — something I thought would be entirely possible with needing to take less engineering classes, more Spanish courses — but this has been nowhere near feasible, and I have started to consider dropping both Spanish courses and just finishing my major. I am noticeably more busy now than I ever have been in all of school, and I am shocked that I have not completely burned out yet this semester. However, pondering this devastates me since Spanish has become one of one of my traits, and I have always seen myself throughout college graduating in 4 years with my major and minor.In conclusion, I have spent so much time attempting this Spanish minor and I feel like I am letting my past and maybe future self down by dropping it when I am so close, but my present self really doesn't want to spend the rest of my semester on this ridiculous grind. This is the most impactful decision I've come to in college, and I'm having difficulty coming to terms with either outcome. I would hate to end up regretting dropping my minor. Has anybody else been in a similar situation with advice to share? Thanks!"

This, of course, upset him. He has a very expensive subwoofer/speaker set so he decided to play music very loudly as to annoy me, making it more difficult for me to study.Right before the test started, I set up everything in the bedroom [where we have a desk], and requested that he please lower the music a bit because my test was about to start. He waited until my test started to start playing the music on max volume and started screaming/singing the lyrics. This continued throughout the entire duration of the exam. Around the 1hr mark he started barging into the room, asking if the test was already over, pounding on the door loudly. Right after the 2hr mark he got into the room, leaving the door open, screaming at me about how ""my professor is a fag"", how I should just drop out of school, how I'll have to repay him later for the time he allowed me to go to school, how its impossible for anyone to remain silent for two hours, how most couples live in a one bedroom apartment and its impossible to expect someone to not enter the bedroom in 3 hours when they also pay half of the rent, how he was going to force me to give the professor a bad review and he wanted to know his name so he could complain to the school about the test being too long, etc, etc, etc.While all of this screaming was going on, the professor said we only had 10 minutes left to submit the test.

Even for HW, I wasn't ripping my hair saying I hate math or physics, but I didn't get much enjoyment doing the work. It only felt good once in a while when you solved that hard problem. I have always been the type of guy that liked building and fixing stuff. E.g phones, electronics, furniture, etc . . . So science and tech have always been my interests. As a side note, I still like the trade I picked. I love the hands-on aspect of the trades where you get to work with tools and see how things actually operate and function.

Also, if there are engineers who are from Canada reading this, is engineering in demand in Canada because I heard of grads who graduated engineering and after all those 4 years couldn't find a job and had to become a supermarket manager or something completely unrelated.

And we work in a group of 4 people.2 of the students began work on the simulation required. Every time I've asked them if there is anything I can do to help its always been ""Nothing right now"", or ""It would take hours to explain it to you at this point, its too complicated. We'll solve it on our own quicker"". Whatever. We are getting good grades on everything else so far. MnehDuring the semester transition break where we had PLENTY of time, I messaged one of them, several times over the course of the break. Is there anything I can be doing. I want to contribute more is there anything I can do. Can you teach me the simulation so I can contribute more when the final report comes. He didn't even open the messages over the whole course of the break. Whatever, in my head. We're getting good grades. I'm doing my part with everything else that has to be done. I'm ASKING for somethings to do. Whatever, they don't want help who cares.But now, I ask them out of curiosity how many hours they put into the simulation. ""Oh me and the other guy had so many sleepless nights.

And we work in a group of 4 people.2 of the students began work on the simulation required. Every time I've asked them if there is anything I can do to help its always been ""Nothing right now"", or ""It would take hours to explain it to you at this point, its too complicated. We'll solve it on our own quicker"". Whatever. We are getting good grades on everything else so far. MnehDuring the semester transition break where we had PLENTY of time, I messaged one of them, several times over the course of the break. Is there anything I can be doing. I want to contribute more is there anything I can do. Can you teach me the simulation so I can contribute more when the final report comes. He didn't even open the messages over the whole course of the break. Whatever, in my head. We're getting good grades. I'm doing my part with everything else that has to be done. I'm ASKING for somethings to do. Whatever, they don't want help who cares.But now, I ask them out of curiosity how many hours they put into the simulation.

I'm a Computer Science Student at a University in Europe, so you might consider this not real ""engineering"", but our math modules are very similar to what you would have when studying say EE or ME.Basically, in Calc I we learn about the standard stuff like limits and series, complex numbers, functions, proofs, set theory, logic etc. Calc II is all about Integration, Differentiation, Linear Algebra and ODEs.So it's a lot of stuff, and all gets tested at the end of the semester in a 2h long exam. That exam is 100% of your grade, you get 3 possibilities for a re-try. You have to have atleast 50% on that exam to pass. If you fail a 3rd time, you can kiss your degree bye-bye, are kicked out of University and are barred from studying the same field anywhere else.This exam usually at the *minimum* has a failure rate of 2/3. That is without Covid and with people regularly taking Lectures and Seminars and doing group study. None of that was available to me. During Covid there were exams with almost 80% of failure rate. These exams are absolutely dreaded by everybody and are widely known to regularly cost people their degree and plans for the future. We even have lots of students who don't even plan to graduate anyway, they start their degree, take a few of the more interesting classes, and drop out to go work in industry.After my first failed attempt, I *really* wanted to nail this one, and studied like **hell**.And I felt good.I really felt I had the techniques down. I have written down literally hundreds of pages with example problems from the Class Materials, I constantly looked for better explanations and examples online. Even though there were challenging problems I felt like I could tackle even the nasty ones. I constantly felt like I had a toolbelt with all the tools I would need and it was all ready to be used.Ever since the start of 2022 this exam was constantly present in my mind and I didn't do much else except either work at my day-job, or study. Also i'm doing this 100% on my own, no tutors, no other students to study with and no Lectures (CalcII Class is taught in Summer, plus the whole covid mess).Integration by Substitution/Parts/Decomp, all kinds of Vector Geometry and Matrix trickery, solving ODEs, differentiation, Taylor Expansions, various tricks to solve ""diff this function using the differential quotient"" problems or ""integrate this function using riemann integrals"" problems. Calculate Surfaces, Volumes, using Integration and ODEs to solve real-world problems. I could go on and on. I felt like I knew every relevant definition by heart and had no problems recalling even small details that easily get lost and trip you up like some trig identities.Then came the exam.When I first sat down in the seminar room, there was the usual nervousness and feeling of dread (I have clinical anxiety issues and depression and am going to therapy for this). I tried to focus on my breathing and to calm down, basically using stuff learned during therapy sessions. But the guy supervising the test was constantly explaining the rules and spoke in a very unfriendly and harsh way, which made me feel kinda irritated and I had a hard time trying to do my impromptu meditation session.When the signal was given that we could turn over the papers and begin, I started to read over the tasks. As usual the Exam is split kind of like thisâ€‹1. Quick questions (usually \~10 short questions, more like brain teasers rather than problems, it's usually best if you know the answer straight away as you can't really figure it out in the heat of the moment)2. Solving a System of Linear Equations3. Two Differentiation Problems, one including a Extreme Value Problem (for what x becomes the volume of this volumetric shape maximal stuff)4. Solving two Integrals, one indefinite and one definite with a pole in the integrand.5. Solve a linear ODE and a nonlinear ODE.As you can see, it might look easy from the description, but the problems itself are far from easy and are definitely not entry level and most invole atleast one twist to make it more complicated. The difficulty mostly comes from the terms itself, it's not like we have to intergrate x\^2+5x+2 dx or something like that.Anyway, I immediately started with the first few of the Teaser Questions, because I thought they must be doable right ? So I started, and immediately go stuck on almost all of them. I went back to the first, and tried a bit more, without success. I looked at the clock, 30 Minutes have passed already. Then came the dreaded fear, this cold sweat feeling, like this whole situation is getting out of hand *fast.* Like I had to defuse a bomb but couldn't even find the wires.It's this kind of feeling where you go from the usual ""think calmly about a problem, formulate your thoughts and write them down calmly"" that I had had during the last 3 months, to a state of mind where you are scribbling down seemingly random flashes of thoughts like a maniac.Plus this hectic, panicky feeling just totally evaporates any kind of rational thought and most of all just breaks any ability to do mental calculations for me. I'm not even kidding when I say I could not multiply simple binomials in my head anymore. I kept scribbling away for simple arithmetic because I just wasn't *sure* my mind got the correct answer, I felt like I was a Toddler learning Algebra for the first time.Before long, the papers looked like absolute shit, like something straight out of ""The Number 23"" where Jim Carrey just scribbles away on the walls. I was in this constant loop of ""wait, what was (1-u)\^2 again ? \*scribble away\* \*shit, that can't be right\* \*cross out\* \*panic intensifies\* \*repeat\*""Plus there was absolutely no plan anymore, like the extreme value problem. In my usual state of mind, I would say ""ok, just define the volume as a function dependent on a variable, find the first and second derivitave, check where the first deriv is zero, and check those zeroes with the second deriv.""I mean c'mon, this is calc 101 and I have done this a thousand times.What I ended up doing was trying to find the zeroes of the original Volume Equation. And of course if you have a complicated shape, plus are only given letters for lenghts, diameters etc, terms quickly become abstract. Certainly too much to just do simple quadratic formula and get a meaningful result. Again, even if I *could* have found some abstract definition of a zero of that function, it wouldn't even have fucking mattered as I needed to find the zero of the derivitave.This went on and on.I almost solved one of the integrals by substitution, but ended up not finding an antiderivative. Instead of then trying with decomposition, I manically tried all kinds of antiderivatives I knew of to see if one would magically fit. Just totally uncoordinated and without any kind of rational thought and calmness.Anyway. I don't want to rant for too long anymore because it really doesn't change the fact.Oh and for the outcome ?I went home, stone faced the entire time, once I closed my door I totally broke down crying, screaming, wailing, started to self harm again (which I hadn't done for ages), just total self hatred combined with an unrelenting feeling of guilt, shame, doubt and pure vicious rage. I really had to restrain myself to not actually destroy valuable things in my apartment or too seriously injure myself as there was broken glass lying everywhere. I felt like I wanted to set myself on fire.Eventually I managed to calm down enough to be able to clean up my apartment, remove all traces of the mess that had just ensued and went on a run. After that I ate something and went to sleep.I'm okay now so don't worry about me, but I just needed to get this off my chest.

Every time I go to them saying “hey I'm extremely burnt out and unhappy” they just say I can do whatever I want with an engineering degree after I graduate and I should just stick with it. However I just feel like it puts my life on hold when I could be doing something that actually pertains to what I want in life. Are they right? Is it worth hating everything and isolating myself for the next couple years to get this degree and do something else completely? Should I just switch to a different engineering major that isn't physics based(industrial and systems, bio an ag, etc.).

Aerospace/mechanical double degree. I've been crying on and off for about a week now. Four exams in the next two weeks. Ones 20% of my grade. Ones 35%, ones 13% and the final one is 9% of my final grade. I know I need to study for them, but every time I pick up my pencil I start crying because I'm overwhelmed by it all. Parents aren't any help, they just tell me to suck it up and get through it. Roommate has been an asshole to me and the atmosphere of the room has been stifling. I haven't slept well since semester started. It feels like I'm going insane. I see everyone around me in my classes and I'm dying while they're chugging along. My friends told me that my classes this semester would be easy and I'm dying in 4/5 of them. I can't stand being on campus anymore because it feels like I'm being slowly choked. If anyones listening, I could use a hug and a shoulder to cry on rn. Idk if I'll make it to may."

Worst of all, the project I am doing this semester for credit is completely new to me, and I have no idea what I am doing. I was brought in expecting to be working with a team, but I am more or less all on my own without a good idea of what is going to work and what won't. I almost feel as if I want to back out of it because I'm not who these people expect me to be, but I know even if I fail it I will learn something from it so I might as well stay.

To preface, I went into this school wanting to change my major so badly. I didn't feel like being a chemical engineer and was looking toward other prospects. When we all got locked inside, looking for those other prospects was a challenge or not feasible. Wasn't able to go to different school clubs or learn around campus other than be on zoom which ended up being a big blanket over my productivity. Through not entirely enjoying my major for a year, and not being able to go out and do anything else, I formed more unhealthy/self destructive habits and ended up failing a majority of classes. Now that we were technically out of it - we are still yo yod back and forth since 90% of classes are still online. Now that I'm a junior, I decided against changing my major and due to my efforts - or lack there of - last year I took 6 classes last quarter and 5 this quarter. I keep piling things on, with work, more clubs, more interests Im now at a burnout spot I didn't want to be in.

I'm at such apathy towards it all I want to do is just go to bed. I'm tired, I'm burnt, I've spent every day for nearly 2 weeks of 16 - 20 hours of studying, and yet I'm still failing. I just feel like I don't care anymore. I just will retake the classes later.

This class is the combination of all the unholy parts of an engineering degree. And for the low low price of 4 credits it is a literal engineering student's hell.

Not only is this system designed entirely form scratch, but it has to adhere to arbitrary rules and restrictions which seemingly change/update every week without warning. These changes cause massive headaches in redesign and coordination with other teammates. On top of this, we are required to also do the following every week:1- Attend a 2.5 hour lab. These labs include lengthy pre and post lab assignments. TA's for this lab treat you condescendingly at best. Grading for these assignments is strict, and it is almost impossible to get 100% unless you spend hours working on them. If you miss or skip any of the labs you cannot pass the class. Also, none of the labs are available for make-up, even for legitimate 2- Finish a quiz. These are worth 10% of your final grade, no big deal right? Wrong. If you do not achieve at least a 60% average on these quizzes you cannot pass the class.3- Participate in a weekly team meeting.This class has turned an otherwise interesting subject into a living nightmare.

I'm in a little dilemma over what the future holds for me. I am currently in my final year of studying electronic and electrical engineering. My reason for choosing this field of study was because of my love for mathematics, physics, and analytical thinking, back in secondary school. I'm performing well in college because I have been acquiring above-average-grades. I like engineering.But there's a big problem. I am from a third-world country. The engineering profession is in a big mess. There is no well-paying job for the average engineering graduate. There is no silicon valley, no massive employment opportunity in the power sector, no big chance in the telecommunications sector either. Even if you manage to get a job as a graduate trainee, the highest amount you will get is the equivalent of US$100 to US$150 per month. The cash is not enough to rent a good one-room apartment. Also, during one of my internships, I discovered the poor working conditions for engineers in the industrial areas. Many of them don't have the required PPE to shield them from danger. The junior engineers keep complaining about everything. Furthermore, one of my professors in college warned my entire class that professional engineers are treated like shit, not only in my country, but in some other parts of the globe. He told us to go for a Masters.... and pursue an MBA. Perhaps, maybe an MBA will give an engineer a place among the board of directors (I can't say) He said engineers have little or no financial voice on industrial operations (which results in low pay). In fact, to cap it up, every single sector in my country is a big ball of mess that can't be quenched anytime soon (healthcare, tourism, politics, technology, financial sector e.t.c you name it). Bear in mind, I still love engineering. But these conditions are really discouraging. However, another area that interests me at the moment is machine learning and artificial intelligence. I code decently well too. Computer science catches my interest.Consequently, my nuclear family have been persuading me to get a second degree in nursing. With a nursing degree, they claimed that there is a chance that I could get a well paying job in America, Canada, Australia, or a first-world country. I figured that they are right. The requirement is to apply to a nursing agency or council, write a standardized English test, and pass the necessary exams. Also, the richest members of my extended family are nurses in the US and the UK. The pressure from my immediate family has been really intense. They claim that I have the mental capability and brilliance to pull through a nursing degree.

I wanted to share my experience with everyone here regarding the FE Exam since I know a lot of students will have questions. A little background: I'm a senior in Chemical Engineering graduating this May. I'm a 3.5/4.0 GPA student and my school is an all right school, in the Top 100 but not Top 50 of ChemE departments in the US. I honestly only wanted to take the FE because it would look good on my resume to land a job out of college, I don't plan on doing any PE kind of work. But it's always nice to have it under your belt. I scheduled the FE about three months ahead of the test date. This gave me plenty of time to study. In the end, I never even studied for it. Senior year is tough and very time consuming, with all of the Design projects and such.I ordered the NCEES Practice Exam as well and didn't crack it open until two days before the actual exam. I was also extremely sick for two weeks before the exam so I did not want to do any studying whatsoever. Took the exam while I was sick (confirmed that it was not covid and not contagious). My ""studying"" for the FE consisted of cracking the book open and going straight to the solutions for all of the questions to see how they were solved. Obviously this is in no way a good way of studying for school, but since this is sort of a refresher exam of everything we've learned, I went ahead and took the easy way. Taking the exam was pretty chill. It's very secure, you have to pat yourself down, can't have the cover of your calculator, and only your ID, calculator and locker key are allowed to be on you during exam time. There were two parts with an option 25 min break at the mid point. My exam was broken up to 58 questions for the first part and 52 questions for the second part. As I mentioned before, I was still recovering from my illness so I had no want to be there, so I kind of didn't take it seriously and finished with about 30 mins left. I had a good feel for about 40-50% of the questions, the rest were really a toss up. It really isn't as easy as others make it out to be. I mean there is stuff from Year 1 that I COMPLETELY forgot. There was some Organic Chemistry that I forgot, etc. In the end, I felt very confident that I got at least 40% right and was pretty confident that I got 50% right. I think the second part of the exam was easier than the first part. The first part was more general engineering (DiffEq) and ChemE questions (Orgo), second part was strictly ChemE (mass transfer, heat transfer, reactions) with some Ethics at the end. Got my results in about a week and I passed! The grading is I guess curved, it depends how others taking the same exam as you did, so there isn't really a set ""passing rate"". My tip to whoever is taking it is don't be stressed out about it. You've made it this far, if you are 100% unsure about an answer, chances are others taking the exam are unsure as well. Try to split the time up pretty evenly, but leaving more time for the second part because for me, those were heavier calculations. They gave you this laminated notebook to do your calcs on and such. TLDR; FE exam was harder than I expected but definitely doable, even if you do little studying. Obviously it depends on the person and how much they have learned so far, but the exam is really 95% everything covered in school. I still urge you to review material from your field before the exam, I used the NCEES Practice Exam. Make sure you stay hydrated and get a good night's sleep before the exam.

I should be ~~sleeping~~ working on my capstone project right now, but instead I'm posting this to vent about how downhill this semester has gone lately.â€‹My classes are going pretty well this term except for one: Vibrations. I failed the first exam by a longshot, and scored 18% under the class average on the second exam (but still technically passed with a grade above 50). My homework grades are decent but those unfortunately don't matter a whole lot if your exam grades are god awful and drag the course grade down. I'm just at wits end, I don't know what to do anymore. I have been applying the same method of learning and studying that has worked for every class from second year onwards and gotten me above average grades. I try to understand as much theory as possible, I make sure I attempt and understand every single problem posted, I make cheat sheets, I understand the assignments and I start studying at least 5 days in advance. I feel like I understand the material well, and walking into the exam I feel confident yet I'm met with the same disappointing result twice now. I emailed my professor and expressed my concerns, I can only hope she will take pity on my burned out soul and offer some insight or something, *anything*.The exams... It's like the professor somehow caught a glimpse inside my mind and discovered everything I hate about exams, and then proceeded to design them around that set of criteria. The timer is 50 minutes, there are just enough questions so that you need to know how to solve the question immediately or run out of time, and they always involve some sort of mathematical operation I fail to notice. Things like realizing a determinant can be simplified into a form that allows you to use the quadratic equation, or some other algebraic black magic that lets you cancel variables that you think you need to solve the problem but apparently don't. Every second that I fail to see the exact thing I am meant to do makes me more and more anxious, until all I can do is watch the clock and keep thinking about how screwed I am going to be if I don't figure it out. 50 minute exams have been fine in the past because the questions were pretty straight forward if you understood the class, but this is something else and I hate it.The worst part is, if I do fail the course and retake it in the summer, it will be with the same professor. Not that they are bad, they are quite good at teaching, but I know I'll be getting clapped by the exams once again and struggling to hang on for dear life. I'm not sure my burned out mind can handle extending by another semester.","Title: I'm burned out in my last semester and I might fail a class..

The focus would be hardware design but he emphasized that as the hardware in robotics is linked with the controls and software side I would have to do some additional reading and online courses on the side to gain a deeper understanding of those topics also (he didn't go into detail on what exactly). He also mentioned that he expects about 20-25 hours of work per week over a 6 month timespan and that he would first do a 2-3 week trial period to determine if I am actually a good fit. This really seems like a challenging thesis but also a potentially very powerful gateway into both robotics and academia (which both seem very interesting to me). Now I'm unsure if I should accept it (have to decide until monday). The thing is that I'm currently involved in a leading position in a student club and our project is in it's final stage, meaning that I have been basically working 50-60 hour weeks for the past months and will continue to do so until about mid-april when the car we build is hopefully assembled. With this in mind and with me wanting to also do some challenging but interesting classes starting next semester I'm unsure on how to proceed. This seems like a great opportunity on one hand and a perfect recipe for burnout on the other. I'm especially wary of the idea of putting in far more effort than for the average thesis and not meeting their high expectations and getting a 'bad' grade in the end. The thing is that I'm very passionate for engineering and definitely able to put in the work - after all I wouldn't be where I am by being a 'least possible effort to get the degree' type of person. I'm just unsure if the price is worth the reward here. Also I have been focusing so much on college-related work in the past years that some areas of my private life (\*cough\* GF \*cough\*) have been greatly neglected and I should probably take some time for myself to improve that lest I become even more of a one-sided person. What should I do? Maybe I'll ask if a similar opportunity will still be available in like 3-4 months and just start the thesis later.

I have a mandatory internship to complete which was supposed to start last month. I have been on the look for over 5 months now and I only managed to get 4 interviews which I absolutely nailed and received great feedback on, but somehow a week or so later still got rejected!

Can code in 3 too. I have a solid handling of 3D modeling. As for my personality and workstyle I am very flexible and adaptable, I am outgoing and I have great communication skills. I am goal-oriented and I always get the job done. I did so well on one of the interviews with one of the big big companies in Germany, that the interviewer started to speak in a manner as if I am with out a doubt getting the job, saying things like “when you join our team will be doing this and that” and “do not worry we WILL give you a 5 month contract for your mandatory internship and we will give another 1 month contract to do your voluntary internship”. The interviewer kept going on and on speaking that way and ngl it seemed very promising, since he was very happy and satisfied with my answers. A week later I receive a very ugly “Unfortunately…”. On another interview with a startup, the interviewer told me he will be sending me an invitation by email to visit the company so that he would show me around and so that I also sign the contract! Great, right? No. He sent an uglier “Leider” which translates to unfortunately. I couldn't resist but ask why I was rejected. Turns out the guy was not gonna be in the country for 3 months and since it is a start up there is no one else to train me in SCM and Logistics. I have called companies, recruiting agencies, checked my application docs with professionals a million times, applied in the very early morning so that my application is at the top of the HR's list of received applications (not sure if this actually how it works, but some friends recommended it and I am desperate lol).

Before graduating I studied mechatronics engineering and was really good at it. I wanted to become an aerospace engineer and thought that the best route for me was to go into a community college for a practical engineering degree in mechanical engineering for 2 years. It is only later on that I realized that I made a mistake because the practical engineering degree simply isn't worth the time and money and that I would need to get full bachelours afterward because 95% of jobs in the military don't give you anything related to the degree (yes its really that bad). In addition, I really didn't find what we were learning interesting and the only classes that got my attention were electronics/programming classes and labs. Also, the tech industry is booming so there are far far fewer good jobs for mechanical engineers outside of a few companies (mostly in the aviation and defense industries, with maybe some manufacturing roles in the technology sector) compared to electronics, computers, and software engineers. In short, I lost all of my interest in the field and lost all motivation to study.For half a year now I wanted to quit and was about to do so this week but two days ago at the very last minute, I got an invitation for a specific position. From what I've heard it's a really good position in RnD that not a lot of people get and can provide good practical experience and possibly make me stand out in the job market. The thing is, that I will have to complete another year of schooling in order to do this and stay an extra year in the military. I will be around 24-25 when I come out as opposed to 22-23 if I quit now (i can't say exactly how much time it's going to take). I know that this can open doors for me in the future but I don't think that this is the right decision to make. The only reason why I managed to get the invitation was that I got good grades but not because I was interested in the material and I feel like I will hate studying another year here. I know that the job might be more interesting than school but I don't know if I will enjoy it all that much, there are people in my class who are really living and dreaming of getting this role and I got it just because, I'm not as interested as them, and yet I got a chance to do it. Moreover, if I will plan on studying something else in the future all of this practical knowledge in the field will be useless and the time I have invested in my education will be wasted (keep in mind that I will still need to do a bachelor's afterward).In short, I don't want to do this just because I can but because I want it to give me something that I will use in the future, and don't want to waste extra 2 years on it if I'm going to switch for a different field.

I joined the lecture 5 minutes before the start time to make sure that things go smooth. As I joined, the professor was already explaining the rules for the quiz, which were not repeated or written anywhere. Apparently, he mentioned that quiz will end if someone submits the quiz with all questions answered. Almost half of the class did not hear or know about this rule since it was mentioned before half of the class joined the zoom call. After we start the quiz, someone submitted it 20 minutes before the final submission time and the professor announced rest of us to submit the quiz right that time. I was not able to finish the questions that I could solve given the time and it is so frustrating. I studied 7 hours non-stop and had really good grasp of the material. I even did my solutions really neat and clear, which was required by professor, which also took most of my time.Is this type of assessment even ethical? Why would such important rule not be repeated or written on somewhere, considering that most of the class did not know about it.I am lost on what to do about it. Should I accept it since I did not join zoom early enough (time for joining was not specified, hence, why I am upset about it). Or should I discuss with the professor, department? Need your help.So far, I am considering to wait before the results are announced, and then I will contact the professor about the situation.Update: Thanks for your insights and recommendations.

I literally psychologically cannot stand it when my capabilities are limited by unfairness. And I really cared about this course, which adds to my frustration too.I already reached out to the professor and I am waiting for his response.Update 2: The professor replied with one sentence that he will be scaling the grades. But this approach would still be faulty. Those who do not write fast and tried to make their solutions as detailed as possible, thinking that they have maximum time by assuming no one would submit early, are still in disadvantage. Their grade will be scaled by same amount as those who had good grades.But anyways, I really do not have time to further discuss the fairness of the issue. Also today I found out that I am in the leftmost part of the grade distribution. Apparently people are happy with their grades and did good. I feel like an idiot wasting my time writing nice and detailed solutions just to lose my time and grade, and just to be put on the same scale as someone who did not put effort into their solutions.

I wanted to become a space engineer and work on futuristic satellites and rockets and whatnot for space exploration. Unfortunately, I think I will need to give up on this dream because my country doesn't have a space program or anything related to it so I decided to switch to aeronautics because it was the closest thing I could find. I decided to do a practical engineering degree in mechatronics and get work experience in the military but discovered that pure mechanical engineering isn't nearly as interesting as I thought. I know it isn't the same as aerospace but I don't know IF or HOW much better it's going to be. Most courses that I take are boring and those that aren't are either lab or somehow related to electronics or basic coding. I have seen the curriculum for next year it doesn't get much better which made me second guess myself, especially looking at career options for the tech industry and everything related as opposed to other sectors. I still like to tinker with things but don't have a lot of experience with other fields of engineering.

I did not take any mathematics during highschool, I did not take any physics during high school; I taught myself these things over a HORRIBLE summer to be able to join the CS bachelors, and later expanded it with a bachelors in mathematics because there's so much overlap (don't think I'm much of a streber, it took me 6 years to complete these overlapping programs, where 4 is expected when you complete all subjects without failure).

The Prof is extremely forgiving and allowed a full 24 hours, open text, as well as class collaboration up to 5 peers. Despite this, one student still thought he needed to hire a Fiverr to do his exam. Unfortunately, the Fiverr was not an engineer and did horribly. He got the lowest score.The student decided that the Fiverr didn't follow through with his agreement of getting at least an 80% and decided not to pay him. In response the Fiverr sent an email to the department chair with all the evidence of his engagement with this student. The department has a 4+1 year program which will give an undergrad student a masters after doing some grad course work in addition to the bachelor. This Thermo class is in the last semester of this program.Well, the cheater will be reported to the dean and will likely be expelled.Don't cheat Thermo. Ask for help."

After completing bachelors, I have to do masters, after that work till 60 or something, stress because I am not able to spend time in retirement because all your life has been spent stressing and you are incapacitated to rest even for a few minutes, and then finally die. However, there is no certainty of achieving peace even after death. Idk what I am doing with life, where I am and where I am going or even where I want to go."

Not to mention that the workterm is a huge amount of money for self directed embedded development work. Dream come true type of workterm. And I get financially and academically penalized if I abandon the workterm at this stage! But to simply be stoic I can: 1. Take the workterm, then delay for a year doing some high level math courses and catch the next promotion with a great gpa.2. Take a work term FAIL, get fucked financially from fees that have already been incurred, but save a year of my life. What do you guys think?"

There are so many unnecessarily stressed, petty, and obnoxious people in this field who just take everything waaaay too seriously, often to the detriment of themselves and others. Here's a couple of examples to get across what I'm trying to say.A while back my senior design team was building in a common area. Naturally, people came by to ask what was up with it cause it was pretty rad looking. This one guy comes up, asks a couple questions, and we start to give him a quick rundown. The guy with him however, quickly interrupts with a nasally ""Uh, you know we're on a schedule, right?"". He even pushed up his glasses when he said that I'm pretty sure. Nothing against people with glasses and nasally voices, that's literally me, but man, chill out. Never thought I'd run into a ""that guy"" in the wild. They weren't even doing anything that important, it was a club (that I had been a part of and was at least keeping tabs on what was going on with some of the projects) and he really had zero reason to be stressed about it. And now what really prompted me to make this post was going over the peer evaluations the freshmen made of each other in their semester long group projects. We specifically tell them that the evals will have a direct impact on their teammates grades, and the amount of people who absolutely go to town on the tiniest things is astounding. Late to a meeting, unavoidable scheduling conflict, don't use their ideas on the final build, types slow, didn't do a part of the project because the team *literally decided to split it up like that*. These are all justifications that people made when giving peer eval scores that could dock someone's project grade by half. Or more!Bad teammates exist. Those are not bad teammate things. It could be that I never caught onto it before, or there's something to people being back in person for the first time in over a year, but I have simply not noticed this much... stuff in the preceding 3 years I've been doing engineering. Good chance I'm just more aware of it now since I'm exposed to a lot more by being a TA though. So let this be a PSA: getting caught up on minor stuff like this really brings down not only yourself with the extra stress and negative mental state it imposes, but it also does the same to those who surround you! You're going to have a much better time when you don't take every minor obstacle as an existential crisis that must be answered with extreme prejudice. When the inevitable actual crisis comes along, you're going to be better able to take it in stride if you can handle the minor stuff without a second thought. What I'm trying to get to is don't be a petty douche who knocks on others for minor shit that has minimal impact on anything. Sometimes it seems like everything is falling apart when you're lodged in the middle of it. So take a breath, a step back, and chill out some.

Post: Finished my BE in MechE last week (woohoo) and have a full time job lined up. Now I'm gonna be honest, I don't have the best grades, in fact last semester I got a D for my design class for the first class (Design 1, and for Design 2 have a B+), and my GPA is 2.7. I honestly never had the best study habits cuz it's hard to focus (I prob have ADHD cuz my bro was in the same boat and he got diagnosed) and am now realizing it. I'm a C to B+ kind of student, but I'm smart enough to know that in today's world, you need a masters to make it in the engineering world.

I was thinking of things like grad school admission and I was wondering, what should I do in uni? Or better, what _can_ I do in uni? I know that top grad schools in the US look a lot at research experience, but I think that's not a thing in my country? I've been looking through my uni website and the only positions are for people that already have a Master degree. So how does that work? Do internships count as research? And how do engineering internships work in Europe? I just never hear people talk about these things in my country so if anybody can explain how to find these opportunities and apply for them that would be great.I'm considering two universities at the moment but both have some really cool student teams, like rocketry clubs, so I'm definitely going to join those, they just sound really exciting. What else is there to do? Grades are obviously important, but aside from those is there anything else I'm missing? Opportunities that I just don't know about?Of course I would like to get into MIT lol, so I'm kind of thinking of this with that in mind. But I know what the chances of that are, so I just also want to spend these next years of my life making cool projects and having cool experiences, and not just spend all my time grinding grades. Any advice you have for me as a prospective student is really appreciated :)","Title: In September I will study Aerospace Engineering, what should I do in university?

My life circumstances have made it such that I can't continue my EE program and I am beyond upset about it. I have to move across the country because my wife's job is taking her elsewhere and I cannot bear the thought of being apart for two years while I finish. I've sacrificed so much, struggled through years of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, but I made it and now I have to switch my major so I can finish it online. I've exhausted every option I can think of, applied to every university who'll accept an application, but so far no success. My GPA at my current university is 3.54, but I had a rough start at community college so I have a combined 2.97 which doesn't seem to be good enough for anyone else. I met with an advisor multiple times and had a meeting with the department head trying to figure out if they'll accommodate my circumstances, but I have four classes with labs left that can't be completed remotely due to accreditation conflicts.So what I'm left with is switching to Info Systems or Cyber security so I can finish my BS in roughly the same amount of time, which can be completed online, but my heart is absolutely broken because I wanted more than anything to be an engineer. Thanks so much for the help and support over the years, you all have made me feel less alone when times got tough.UPDATE: First I'd like to thank everyone for the help and support. You all rock. Several people have mentioned ASU, and you're 100% correct. I applied to their online EE program, but I didn't get into it. I got accpeted into an alternate program, Engineering Management. I just got off the phone with the advisor a little while ago and he told me that the reason I didn't get in was my GPA; I needed a 3.0 and I have a 2.96. However that doesn't include my final grades from this semester which ends next week. Once final grades are posted, I'll send in new transcripts, they'll update my GPA (I'm getting around a 3.5 this semester), and they'll switch me to EE for Fall.

Anytime someone asked about the grading system or if there was a curve it was meet with radio silence. The only response we got was after the final grades were put in saying the grades are final and “curved”. When you go and calculate your grade, you see that the curve was a lie and your grade is the actual grade you got."

I'm aiming to gain a qualification to help me progress my career, hopefully into something more engaging and fulfilling. In addition I'm also heavily involved in a national political campaign. I lost my Dad during the Covid pandemic and I focused my grief into trying to make positive change. I co-founded the Covid-19 Bereaved Families For Justice organisation calling for a public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic with the aim of learning lessons to prevent further loss of life.

I proved I could get these grades the whole time. I have one more day of actually working on schoolwork, just one last presentation. I'm so excited, because I fought like hell to get here.

I'm in my first year of civil engineering in the UK (Manchester uni), not sure if it's the same for other unis in the UK. So far I've always hated the exam season, not because I don't understand the content, but rather the facts that each exam is essentially a game of guessing what formulas or knowledge will be on the exam, memorizing them and do some direct application. I'm not sure if this is the policy of the school of engineering or the individual lecturers' decision, but most exams don't provide a formula sheet (some formulas are provided, but you have to guess which ones). The math exams which do come with a formula booklet, is for the entire math department so includes many useless formulas (for engineering), and omit many useful ones taught in class. The issue is that no matter how good you're at resolving problems (the job of an engineer), you can't score a high mark unless you know the specific formula needed (which can be a specific trig relation or math rule). I would have no problem we're allowed a formula sheet or a comprehensive formula sheet is provided to us before hand, but having so much of my grade hinging on my ability to recall a specific formula, which sometimes aren't even shown in the module, is just stupid. I've always been a believer that the ability to memorize formulas contributes nothing significant to one's ability to be a good engineer or a good problem solver; if a formula is so common in my work that not knowing it would slow me down, then I would see it enough to know it. And if it's critical but uncommon, a few minutes to look up a formula not only isn't a lot of time, but should be done because a engineering project shouldn't hinge on one person's memory. It just really bugs me when I manipulated all the variables correctly, but can't solve a question because I don't know a common formula that can be looked up in a minute in real life, makes me wanna write something passive aggressive like ""if this was in real life, I can calculate the answer in 2 minutes by looking up x equation"".While less of an issue, restricting the use of graphing calculators is to me, without good justification. I do understand not wanting to price out students not able to afford one. But it's a tool that as a engineer, you can always have access to in your career if you want. And it's immensely useful especially when it comes to solving problems by trial and error (at least if you understand how to leverage the calculator's power).Thank you to everyone who read through this rant, I don't expect anything to change given the condition of this school, but oh well.td:dr exams are basically just memorization contests, and the best way to score high marks is to just memorize everything with little regard to problem solving. Calculator policy is stupid.","Title: Rant, I'm tired of being judged by my ability to remember arbitrary facts in university. Post: I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit, so feel free to point out the right one or remove this.Before I start, I need to say I'm not complaining because I'm failing, I'm currently averaging close to a 1st (A for non-UK readers). I'm in my first year of civil engineering in the UK (Manchester uni), not sure if it's the same for other unis in the UK. So far I've always hated the exam season, not because I don't understand the content, but rather the facts that each exam is essentially a game of guessing what formulas or knowledge will be on the exam, memorizing them and do some direct application. I'm not sure if this is the policy of the school of engineering or the individual lecturers' decision, but most exams don't provide a formula sheet (some formulas are provided, but you have to guess which ones). The math exams which do come with a formula booklet, is for the entire math department so includes many useless formulas (for engineering), and omit many useful ones taught in class. The issue is that no matter how good you're at resolving problems (the job of an engineer), you can't score a high mark unless you know the specific formula needed (which can be a specific trig relation or math rule). I would have no problem we're allowed a formula sheet or a comprehensive formula sheet is provided to us before hand, but having so much of my grade hinging on my ability to recall a specific formula, which sometimes aren't even shown in the module, is just stupid.

I've put in about 3-4 hours of studying and practicing some problems today. A little bit worried about the exam coming up but I feel like I'll be fine if I keep practicing. It's mainly focusing on applications of integration. We also have homework which are like 10 problems weekly or so that the professor grades to give us feedback which I think is a great thing. The only downside is that it's online so it's harder to form group studying and communicating with others in the class.,Title: Who's taking calc 2 this summer?. Post: I started yesterday.

Till my 10th standard ( School) i was a good student ( academic wise i mean) and being from India, thus everyone includes my teachers, parents, and relatives insisted me to do engineering as its the most common chosen stream for boys here is someone is above average/good in studies. But the thing was i always hated maths so much, that i got 85+ in all other subjects and 80 in science but 59/100 in maths, this is the reason i wanted to do commerce in my 11th and 12th grade and then do some degree like BBA ( Bachelor of Business Administration ) as i was always interested in this business sector, but then again as I told earlier everyone that i knew kept telling me anything other than engineering is not good for me, it will not give me high paying job,status etc and after hearing all this i agreed to what my parents & relatives wanted and thought of doing engineering. Though, instead of choosing the most common path to do engineering i chose something different, which i also came to know, after i completed my 10th standard, which is diploma/polytechnic in engineering. For those who don't know, diploma is a 3 year course which a student can opt for after completing 10th, then after completing it, can go for engineering course, which is reduced to 3 from 4 years, because diploma students spend 1 year extra doing diploma as diploma is of 3 years whereas 11th and 12th in school consists of 2 years, so students who do engineering after doing diploma, gets admission directly in 2nd year in engineering.I have passed diploma in July 2021, however i did get backlogs in math,basic electronics, but i cleared them in online sem ( covid saved me), i wasn't able to understand maths taught to me in diploma, hence failed in 2 attempt, then did clear in online sem. Then after i completed my diploma, i had to look for colleges for engineering admission. I decided to take admission in a tier-3 engineering college here in India, so that fee is not much and academic pressure is also 'maybe' less. But again, my parents who always wish the best for me insisted me to take admission in one of the best private engineering colleges in India by taking education loan for half of the amount of total academic fee. I argued to take admission in that tier 3 college but they asked when you are getting an opportunity in best private college, why to settle for a average institute. I wasn't able to answer this and thought that doing engineering from a good college will make them happy as well. So, thinking all this, i opted to take admission in a very good college with huge building, great infrastructure and atmosphere.I got admission in 3rd sem directly because of my diploma. But, here comes the sad part for me, in 3rd sem only 5/7 final exams were conducted in online mode due to covid ( which i did pass obviously) and only 2/7 in offline mode, which i merely did pass, 33 were the required marks to get pass, and i got 33.Now comes the 4th sem starting Jan 2022, which took place in offline mode as there was no lockdown restrictions now. I attended my lectures,labs and workshops in college, but never really understood anything, i was feeling like only dumb student in my batch. Anyways, i did give my midsems and endsems, currently came back home due to summer break. I am depressed and stressed right now waiting for my result to come, in which i know, i am going to get fail in at least 4/7 majors, which i don't know will i ever be able to clear them in future. As, in my exams all questions consist of numerical and algorithms only, and i for some reason am never able to solve these numericals or even understand them. I see my peers enjoying college life, studying one day before exams, getting good marks, whereas i sit blank in my exam hall, don't really enjoy college life, lost all my self confidence and self esteem. I don't like to/feel uncomfortable talking to people in my college, especially girls, fearing that they will definitely ask me about my grades.I just keep on regretting that why did i make decision of doing engineering when i knew i am not good in maths. I keep wondering that how happy i would have been if i would have done some degree in commerce field instead of engineering. I am wasting my parents money, i am having a student education loan and i hate myself sometime searching 'Painless way to commit su\_ide"" on google.

I also learned that one of professors from our department is leaving our university to teach somewhere else. I am so happy that he leaves, because he was a sexist professor. And he wasn't even a boomer type of old man, who happened to grow up during different time, no, he was older Millenial-young Gen x. For the purposes of this post, let's call him Mr. Bean (though it's not his real name).The semester I had a class with him during junior year, I had an interaction with him that seemed sexist, but not so obviously. I came to his office hours before the class because I saw in online system that our team got 0 for a small group quiz. I politely asked him why that is and if something was wrong, Mr. Bean said he never got our quiz during previous class. I distinctly remembered that my teammate chased him down the corridor in the end of the class to give it in. I told him I'm sure we submitted it, but he stood his ground, and called me “entitled” because I wanted a grade for nothing, and he can't give me grade if he doesn't have quiz. He also made me doubt and said “Are you sure you classmate gave it in?”, making me feel like complete idiot. I stormed out of office in anger, came to class and asked my teammates about the missing quiz, they were surprised and baffled too, so they told me not to worry and we'll go to talk to him after the class. So the guys talk to him after the class and I'm there too, and then turns out the prof has two different folders: one for quizzes and other for different papers. He looks through that other one and says “oh, here's your quiz!”, and smiles back. But of course, he checked that folder only after talking with a male student. No apology followed, but he fixed our grade. It was one of those incidents, when it was hard to tell if he is sexist or just an asshole, but hearing the stories from other female students proved he is both. I talked to other female students from our department, and barely any of them had good experiences with Mr. Bean. There is a girl, who is superachiver, has 4.0 GPA and is president of one of engineering society chapter at our uni. She was getting A- in his class. She came to ask Mr. Bean for an extra credit to boost her grade up to keep a perfect score. I don't know what happened but he yelled at her so badly, she left his office in tears. He also yelled at one of male students in his office hours so badly, he had to send an apology email to him. Then I heard a story from a trans woman from our department, on how even though he didn't explicitly discriminate, she felt very uncomfortable and unwelcomed in his class. Then his female academic advisee complained about him to our chair of the department (who is a woman), so that our chair had to have a talk with him. I feel like he is one of those people, who if he hadn't been engineer, he could've been easily one of those alpha male podcasters spewing misogyny. The worst part is: a lot of guys like Mr. Bean (mostly guys that are like him), and whenever someone points out that some of his jokes are a bit fucked up, they say “oh it's just a joke”. He does have small army of his minions/fan base, who are ready to protect him no matter what. So there was an incident when this got out of control.One of previous semesters during his lectures Mr. Bean really shitted on one of female professors, who taught pre req to his class during semester before that. He explicitly encouraged students to complain about her (even though we do have far more worse male professors in our department then she is). Let's call that female prof Ms. Pancake (again not a real name). So one of his minions decided to mass spread an e-mail to all students in our department asking for testimonies against Ms. Pancake (how she is incompetent prof). I also received that e-mail, and I had no idea what was going on since I wasn't in that class at the time and didn't know that minion-student personally. So recently I happened to talk to a girl who witnessed the entire story, because she was both in Mr. Beans class and class of Ms. Pancake in previous semesters. Turns out that minion didn't like how Ms. Pancake curved a grade at the end of semester, which benefited all students because it boosted up all grades. He said it's unfair (even though his grade went up from B+ to A-!) The problem is that Ms. Pancakes class happened during Spring, and this whole mass spread e-mail situation (during the same time of Mr. Beans class) happened the following fall. So the question is: why would that minion wait entire summer to get the courage and complain about her after the grades had been posted? That was pretty shady. Anyway, I'm so happy he is leaving. I don't know if that's because someone complained or not, or maybe he just got an offer to a different uni, maybe combination of both.One thing I realized: if I didn't talk to fellow female engineering student, I'd never knew that I wasn't alone who had unpleasant experience with him. Please, share your stories with sexist professors from your engineering department. PS. Mr. Bean also had attitude of “I suffered though my academic life, and was traumatized by PhD, to the point that I almost got PTSD, and now I'm so proud of it!” +Superiority complex at its finest.","Title: Sexist engineering professor is leaving our department and I am happy about it.

If that's the case should the grad school curve the letter grade to A-/B+ range so that at least half people could comfortably pass the class with minimum GPA requirement, whether they are pursuing masters or phD.In my undergrad studies, many professors anticipated average grades to be B-/C+ and some classes C range, and only tends to curve only and if the average falls below C.

Would it cause almost half student fail the course if professor uses this metric system where avg. scores converts to C+.As mentioned earlier, the grading standard is lot different in grad school, compare to undergrad, as the minimum passing grade for grad school can range from B to B+ depends on which program I am planning to pursue. For my understanding, some engineering phD programs consider B+ as minimum passing grade, which can be difficult to maintain unless grad school courses are fairly scale.TLDR: Is the grad school curves more fairly, if not generously compare to undergraduate courses.","Title: Is it super difficult to get 3.0 GPA in Grad School especially for Structural, and Materials Engineering program?.

Some even 3-4 but these are hard to get (as much as the default engineering internship). Same effort, 7 times the earning.I will probably end unemployed as to get a job here is ultra hard, like you need to have a double degree in France or Germany and speak the respective languages as engineering is dead here. Much harder than grinding leetcode.And I hate that you have to study for passing tests and not to understand the ins and outs of the subjects. You must “game” the system.Sleep deprivation in messing up with my memory too, I can barely remember peoples names.

My weekdays are like wake up very tired => take narcolepsy med => spend 20 minutes in bed waiting to have mental energy to get ready => eat breakfast and leave home in a hurry so I don't get late => traffic => feel dead inside for 8 hours => traffic => get home with 0 mental energy (I feel hungry but to tired to eat, I spend half an hour lying down before doing anything) and then spend hours on videogames => study for 1 hour => eat dinner => see the stuff I like => sleep late => repeatI can't enjoy my weekends because I lose much of the day replenishing my sleep (I need 9-10 hours of sleep, 12 if I'm sleep deprived) so I don't feel even more dead inside the next week I regret every single day that i didn't go into CS instead of EE as wages are higher and the class load is smaller.EE internships are so hard to get and the pay is half a minimum wage, while there is a fuckton of cs internships that pay 1-2 Brazilian minimal wages. Some even 3-4 but these are hard to get (as much as the default engineering internship). Same effort, 7 times the earning.I will probably end unemployed as to get a job here is ultra hard, like you need to have a double degree in France or Germany and speak the respective languages as engineering is dead here. Much harder than grinding leetcode.And I hate that you have to study for passing tests and not to understand the ins and outs of the subjects. You must “game” the system.Sleep deprivation in messing up with my memory too, I can barely remember peoples names. If I sleep well I have no trouble with names or remembering equations."

Because of this, I chose the easiest subjects in school that would guarantee me the best grades with the least work, so then I could spend all of my free time on studying music. However, I didn't get a teacher. So, in 3 years I barely made progress because I didn't know what I was doing, grew frustrated and didn't end up sticking to my self-study routine.I essentially killed my only dream and passion. Maybe it was too late for me anyway, and I'm just hanging on to a naive dream i made up as a kid. I don't really have much of a chance of going to a music school right now, and even if i somehow went, I don't have enough skills to get a well-paying job (which i know is, even for an experienced musician, difficult to get).The only thing I know is I want to do something creative. My idea was going into electrical engineering so I could come up with creative solutions to problems, and have freedom to build whatever machine I wish. Also maybe tap back into music somehow by focusing on signal processing, maybe build synths, music equipment etc. for a job.It takes a lot of time to grasp certain math concepts, but when I understand I can actually sometimes enjoy it. However, that enjoyment hasn't been enough for me to constantly seek out math problems to do. But i was thinking that maybe if i get the chance to apply my knowledge after college it would become fun, and i could learn to enjoy it. I know there's many students who don't enjoy studying engineering, but I think subjects like physics and math ARE hard to enjoy. It's the application that is the fun part and in college you don't get that opportunity yet. In my opinion it's possible to like **anything** if you truly give it a chance and take time to understand it.The only problem is, I didn't take the required physics OR math lessons that an engineering course requires. This means I would have to spend the entire next year and probably a gap year just to catch up with around 2 years of studying. All for a chance to pursue a major i am not good at nor have a lot of interest in studying, but will hopefully like after uni.So my question is, is studying physics worth it in order to do creative stuff later? I just don't want to fall into the trap of ""go to college and everything will be ok"" and then get stuck in a boring job just hoping to get promoted to a position with more freedom.

After spending about 12 years in school (first six years I messed around and got my act together for the last six), I finally graduated with my BSME. I spent time at a community college and had good enough grades to transfer to a state university but my GPA wasn't great because I had a lot of “withdraws” from my early years of college. I knew going into university that my GPA wouldn't look favorable for internships so I did everything I could to look great on resume. I joined an engineer club and project as soon as I transferred and participated in “workforce development” programs.

After spending about 12 years in school (first six years I messed around and got my act together for the last six), I finally graduated with my BSME. I spent time at a community college and had good enough grades to transfer to a state university but my GPA wasn't great because I had a lot of “withdraws” from my early years of college. I knew going into university that my GPA wouldn't look favorable for internships so I did everything I could to look great on resume. I joined an engineer club and project as soon as I transferred and participated in “workforce development” programs.

The return to in person from a full 2nd year of online classes did not go well with me, and I struggled. I missed classes, was well behind the majority of the time, and barely scraped by. I failed my first class in my university career. I didn't feel like I belonged with everyone else in my program.All the while, everyone was applying for co-ops and internships, an opportunity at my university where you can go and gain work experience for a full year after your 3rd year, and return for studies after.I kept applying and applying, with no responses at all. October, November, December went by. Nothing. January, February, all the way until my final exams. No interviews, no messages back.My grades were decent from 1st and 2nd year, and with my abysmal 3rd year soon being included in my transcript, I didn't think I would be able to secure anything. I would go straight into fourth year whereas the majority of my friends would go gain valuable experience, and I would have to graduate without anyone I knew, with no significant work experience and probably a terrible transcript.Application opportunities for this internship year closed July 29th. On July 8th, I had submitted a number of applications, at this point desperate to just get absolutely anything back. But every-time I knew I had to attach my transcript, seeing how I did in third year, I was not confident at all.One of these positions did not require a transcript. And it seemed right up my ally, with and interesting company and a challenging role. I reached out to the hiring manager with my resume and cv, and by then end of the day I received a call back asking to setup an interview!I was beyond overjoyed, my first actual response and they wanted to interview me! I immediately accepted, and an interview was scheduled for July 11th.Long story short the interview went well in my eyes but I was very nervous. It was an in person interview which surprised me as well, and only made me more on edge that I would fuck it up somehow. It concluded with “we have some more applicants to interview, you'll probably hear back within 1 - 2 weeks on our decision”.The next day, I got a call. I got the job! I actually couldn't believe it. Within 4 days I had had an interview and secured my year of work experience, all within 2 weeks of final applications.Been here for 3 weeks now, and it's been amazing. I couldn't ask for a more perfect fit for me.In the end, the point I want to get across is to not lose hope. What I had thought would be a last minute effort with probably no success given my previous experience in the application process turned into this. Probably more places out there don't care about your transcripts. What I thought would be the worst year of my university career might shape up to be the best.Apply to everything. Do your best.

This fall she will be an Engineering Senior in Materials Engineering. She *seems* to be improving. This fall will be her sixth year. If she kept up this semester, she would complete her Engineering degree next May. I think she's taking on too much load given her past struggles in Junior year.Her difficulties started when she found an Engineering class too hard to handle (Especially the subject Transport Phenomena). Then Covid Hit. Issues with room-mates created some stress. She was also feeling down due to 1) not being able to cope 2) Disappointing parents (so she said) - after the initial shock/disapproval (for being kept in the dark), we parents quickly supported her (this was last fall, October 2021). I can relate to this having experienced failures in my own education, but eventually finished. Both me and my wife are supporting her.Last (spring 2022) semester was a catchup, and she says she completed/passed all except one (i.e. failed one course, but passed others). The apparent critical decision was to reduce the course load... she said it made a huge difference. Summer she was at home, doing the easier Gen Ed electives. She cleared those apparently. I am going to check her transcripts (if she agrees to , that is) - just to make sure I am making the right assumptions about her courses. She did show me her advisor signing off on her courses. But I will request her to see more of the documents - just to ensure she's on the right track. She has my support (I am paying as well for all this). More important to me is that she is accountable to herself for her own future. I think she's very anxious we all have supported her without fail. She had a part-time job at her university and wants to continue that.The best scenario is she copes far better this semester. And scrapes through. She seemed to do well in her 3 Engineering internships (Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior internships)... we always thought she'd have a good career ahead of her, now we don't want to look too far in the future, instead just take it one step at a time.She is taking a full course load 12 credits + 3 credit Engineering elective which she says is easy. I am deeply worried we are going back to the same issue, of overloading - coming under pressure and regressing. Obviously finishing sooner would be good, but I think its safer to have a more reasonable workload. I also think working (while providing a release for her) will also add to her workload/time-stress.She has promised to continue seeing her therapist to manage stress.I know engineering is hard,.. especially the subject Transport Phenomena. And engineering senior design (not sure how hard it will be, she says its a group -graded class). She seems confident mostly of managing this. I feel this is a stiff challenge this semester.I'd rather she finishes her degree in any field. Is that also an option, to switch to an 'easier' field and complete degree requirements.

So I'm in my junior year and actually just took Calc 4 (multivariable calc) over the summer just to get it over with. Took the final today and hope I did alright and don't know my final grade yet. My question is, how relevant are a lot of these concepts like optimization and green's/stokes'/divergence theorem in actual engineering courses? I had a really difficult time grasping a lot of the concepts outside of just being able to do multiple integrals and partial derivatives. Seemed like a lot of the stuff in this class was very abstract and at my specific university none of the engineering courses have this class as a prerequisite, it's simply a graduation requirement.","Title: Relevance of Calc 4 in engineering.

It always took me a little bit longer to learn the information than the rest of the “bright kids” and I had to do a lot of studying to still be in the same playing field as those kids. Nonetheless, this June I ended up graduating among the top 20 students in my class of nearly 500 kids and got into some of the most selective colleges in NY thanks to my high grades, extracurricular activities, and several board positions.I recently started college at a competitive university with a mechanical engineering major. I picked it because I love math and science (especially astronomy) and could see myself working in the aerospace industry. As bad as I want this to work out, I am BURNT. I felt like I dedicated every ounce into high school and I just can't shake the senioritis. My summer vacation was only a month and a half and was quiet chaotic due to personal issues so I feel like I didn't get to recuperate. I'm going into a hard school for a hard major and I have no more drive, passion, energy, etc. I'm finding it hard to muster up the dedication this field requires. This is only worsened by the extreme imposter syndrome I'm feeling right now. I was never on the robotics team or anything and the only knowledge I have from AP Calc and regular physics is making me feel dumb compared to my peers. While my school is a good STEM school, the professors are far from good. My MEC class is a flipped course and requires me to design and build a robot by the end of the first semester. I'm quite literally shitting bricks; I have no clue how to code, program, work with circuits, etc. and the reviews on ratemyprofessor claim my professor doesn't exatcly do a great job at teaching it. I'm really questioning if I can handle this and have what it takes.I honestly don't know what I'm looking to gain from this post….maybe for someone to tell me they're in the same boat?? or they've felt the same at one point? how to cure burnout and find motivation lol?

I didn't go to the doctor 2 years later till it was too late & was diagnosed with a chronic condition.Things only gotten worse once full lockdown was instated.

I powered through the first 3 semester of freshman classes, all online, but after the 3rd I was at my limit. A mixture of deja-vu, loneliness and my aching back that keeps getting worse started to push me close to the edge. My grades from the 3rd semesters were all Cs, and took my CGPA down from a 3.60 to a 3.06.I didn't speak out to anyone about this. At this point it just takes one small issue to completely break me. I remembered it was specifically my statics professor that was unwilling to respond to me emails. At the moment I stopped thinking rationally & lashed out at the professor. No excuses, it was all on me for turning a small issue to a major one. I just stopped attending classes after that and withdrew from my classes early 2021 when I was a sophomore.For 2 years straight, I became a hermit. I don't really know how useful this is but, I learned art & gotten into digital arts (can't pose them since it'll reveal my identity). Also learned the basics of coding on the side. I really enjoyed both and am still doing them today.Unfortunately, my aching back has gotten so bad I couldn't move my entire upper body and had to lie flat on the ground.I remember waking up every day feeling like dead weight to my parents, and just think that they could've gotten a better son.

I know that whats happening to me now is normal and I should be able to talk more openly about it but I simply can't I don't know why.I am nearly at the end of my first year in Uni, I am studying Software Engineering and I can just say it is pretty f hard. Which I didn't have a problem with until recently. My grades were okay is the best I can say (grades go from 6 to 10 and until now I had: two 10, two 9, one 8 and one 6 which was basically gifted to me because at the time I had covid). I just got a 6 from Calculus 2 today and I am devastated I studied for 3 months day and night and I got the worst possible grade.

Which I didn't have a problem with until recently. My grades were okay is the best I can say (grades go from 6 to 10 and until now I had: two 10, two 9, one 8 and one 6 which was basically gifted to me because at the time I had covid). I just got a 6 from Calculus 2 today and I am devastated I studied for 3 months day and night and I got the worst possible grade.

I've been in college for 2 years now and I've gotten absolutely nowhere in my curriculum. I went into college with no course credits and have been taking at least 1 (this semester I'm taking 2) “filler classes” that doesn't apply to my bachelors in mechanical engineering degree. I haven't even completed my entire first year curriculum requirements because it's riddled with prerequisites that require math courses I didn't/don't have.

Now, I've never been amazing at math but I enjoy it when something finally “clicks”. The course is taught by a (if you want to call him a professor) last semester graduate who has no actual teaching skills. He's smart and know the material, but his teaching methods are horrible and he goes way to fast. We just got grades for our first exam and I got a 57/100. This is the worst grade I've gotten since I've started college and it's very heavy on my conscious. But I wasn't an outlier, the class average was 50-59%. I want to get a tutor but am scared to and I know myself well enough that if I learn independently I will eventually lose motivation. This puts me in a dilemma, I either drop this class at the end of the semester and retake the class in a winter intersession (a 5 or so week course) or take the class in the spring along with 4 “filler” courses (I know I will be miserable doing this). Then there's the third option, somehow manage to pass this course with a C and be stumped throughout the rest of my math courses throughout college.This current course along with what I consider garbage gpa (2.5) for a mechanical engineer, makes me very fearful as a student. I fear that I'm eventually gonna hit a big enough roadblock that convinces me that I shouldn't be in college. I have the drive and motivation but my mental health and academics have started to turn south. I want to be a successful engineer someday, but I also want to be happy while learning to do so. No other major in college has ever applied to me, so it's this or a trade, and I personally don't think a trade suits me.

I knew before the exam that I might not be able to solve the problem so I tried to focus on the theory but it was completely different from what I had studied. Most questions were things the professor only briefly mentioned once in class and didn't speak about it again until now, and the problem we had to solve was very different to the ones we saw in class.Fortunately this exam is worth ""only"" 30% of my grade for this unit, but I'd count myself lucky if I get 10%. The other 70% is 20% my individual homeworks, of which I have about 17%, and 50% the progress of a maintenance plan we did in teams.

I ask that if anyone recognises me to respect my privacy.A few months ago, I accepted a graduate civilian role in the DoD with all my onboarding paperwork already completed and just waiting for my clearance.

Out of my four courses (electric power systems, capstone, antenna design, and distributed technologies), I am concerned with the first two of these. The latter two have been going strong all semester and I do not expect to see issues come up.To elaborate upon my two subjects I am concerned about.1. A power electronics course (Electric Power Systems) which is compulsory for all default (no major) electrical engineers even though it is not relevant to my job offer. For test 1 (worth 10% of the total), 75% of the class received a fail grade including myself. This grade will not be curved however it will be replaced by the final exam if the final exam is higher. In response to this failed test, I have spoken to my professor and I did quite strong for the first practical assignment (worth 12.5%) so I am somewhat hopeful that I will make it through. Additionally I also borrowed a textbook and have spoken to friends that have done the course in previous years for advice. 2. Capstone project. My final report is due in 3 weeks and I have hit a number of hurdles. I chosen the solar car as my capstone as I found it interesting. The challenges are listed below.* My supervisor has instructed the electrical students to write our final reports separately. This provides a bit more of a headache than being able to delegate report writing between team members as was done for the progress (half year) report.* My role in the team was not as technical as a usual capstone as I also did a lot of the leadership and sponsorship work too. My technical contributions are mainly focused on the PV aspects of the car. While my supervisor has said he is happy with what I have done so far, I am a little bit nervous of not having enough detail.* On the other hand, the group did perform very strong for the progress report with a score of 90.

Since I stayed up so late solving that problem I didn't have a chance to atudy for another exam (power electronics) I had the following day and I only managed to study very little and write down some formulas.The power electronics exam was also fucked up, 6 problems in and hour and a half and each problem took you about 20 minutes if you knew how tosolve them, which I didn't. Again most, if any, didn't finish the exam and I only managed to solve about half of the exam.The power electronics exam is worth half of the grade with homeworks, practice reports and participation making up the other half. Fortunately the power electronics professor is kinda laid-back and usually helps you if you have worked in class and I'm the second guy in the class with the most participations, but I'd have to have everything I've done right to pass.TL;DR Had to sacrifice one course to pass another one and now I might fail both"

I probably wouldn't even need to show up to the lecture to earn a 4.0 this time around.The only reason I'm considering re-taking the course is because I want to raise my major GPA (currently 3.76) so I can apply for competitive graduate school programs, such as MIT EE. Doing so would put me at 19 credits for the semester, but I was wondering if anyone applying for graduate school ever had the same situation and what the outcome was.

To add onto her whole on time fiasco, today during class, while she was setting up the class and we werent doing anything yet, a student came in 3 minutes late and went to sign the attendance sheet. She came over to him and literally grabbed the paper out of his hand and did the whole ""dont be late"" bs again, even though class LITERALLY hasnt even started and she is falling behind in her adult duties. Later after finishing the warm up, my group decided to check her rate my professor score(which was terrible), and when she saw us grouping together after finishing our work, she got very upset, raised her voice and said that we shouldnt be doing other class work(she thought we were doing a different class hw i dont know why), and that we should be helping others with their work or sit their and be quiet(even though that has never been apart of the directions). This is all in the first 2 weeks of class, and her attitude has only gotten worse. She has seemingly always been like this since after asking other students and GTAs, they say the same thing that shes highly disrespectful and how they once got in an argument over her poor attitude which got the student ejected for the day.

His lectures are useless, his slides are incomplete, he barely posts *any* notes online, the notes he does post are very messy and hard to interpret, and I just have never been able to learn anything from that class. I tried to teach myself using the textbooks but didn't get very far that way.I just decided to write a bunch of formulas and stuff on my cheat sheet, understand how to do specific questions from the homework and hope for the best.Now, I could have approached this much better. I probably should have gone to office hours, asked more questions, taken better notes in class, paid more attention in class and grinded a bunch of YouTube videos to try and learn this material. But at the same time, the quality of the teaching is abysmal.So part of this is absolutely on me. Part of it is also on the prof.Through a combination of my horrible study habits, the lack of resources and the professor's inability to teach, I had a catastrophic experience on my midterm exam. I didn't fully finish a single question, my solutions were probably wrong anyway, and my writing was messy. It was a complete and utter shitshow in every way.Luckily, everyone else I've talked to also found it extremely difficult.This has never really happened to me. Ever. It honestly feels like some kind of nightmare. I am in a position where I may end up failing this class.I can probably scrape by with between 50 and 60 in that class if the rest of my grades are mediocre.I don't know what else to do besides studying very, very, very very hard for the final, grinding the rest of the assignments or just praying for a curve.It just feels bad.

Like a 20% type of situation.The class shouldn't be that difficult either. But the professor is really terrible at teaching. His lectures are useless, his slides are incomplete, he barely posts *any* notes online, the notes he does post are very messy and hard to interpret, and I just have never been able to learn anything from that class. I tried to teach myself using the textbooks but didn't get very far that way.I just decided to write a bunch of formulas and stuff on my cheat sheet, understand how to do specific questions from the homework and hope for the best.Now, I could have approached this much better. I probably should have gone to office hours, asked more questions, taken better notes in class, paid more attention in class and grinded a bunch of YouTube videos to try and learn this material. But at the same time, the quality of the teaching is abysmal.So part of this is absolutely on me. Part of it is also on the prof.Through a combination of my horrible study habits, the lack of resources and the professor's inability to teach, I had a catastrophic experience on my midterm exam. I didn't fully finish a single question, my solutions were probably wrong anyway, and my writing was messy. It was a complete and utter shitshow in every way.Luckily, everyone else I've talked to also found it extremely difficult.This has never really happened to me. Ever. It honestly feels like some kind of nightmare. I am in a position where I may end up failing this class.I can probably scrape by with between 50 and 60 in that class if the rest of my grades are mediocre.I don't know what else to do besides studying very, very, very very hard for the final, grinding the rest of the assignments or just praying for a curve.It just feels bad. The prospect of failing a class is profoundly terrifying.UPDATE: I got 45%, which is higher than the class average. Hoping for a curve :)"

Single. Semester.**Some are worried how they will tell their parents. Others are worried that it will put their scholarship in jeopardy. And a few will think of themselves as failures overall.I always like to start out with some reassurance . . . you are not the first engineer to fail a class. Many of the successful engineers that you see out in the field have failed a class or two while they were in school.Yes, it sucks, but it is not the end of the world by any means. Get this notion that you are lesser or not worthy of being in engineering school out of your head!The other thing I tell them is that we have to focus on what we can control and put aside what we can't. You failed the class and that can't be changed now that the semester is over. Therefore, the important thing is to figure out WHY IT HAPPENED and then implement a plan so IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. As you move forward, the fact that you overcame a failure will become a motivational source for you to overcome other distractions and hardships you will undoubtedly encounter.**So Why Does it Happen?**What I have found, is that most students do not fail because of lack of trying. Honestly, if they did, then it would be an easier problem to solve.The truth is, that most of them are putting in the time, but they are not really putting in the right kind of studying.In short, most are studying harder, but really should be studying smarter. Without a focused plan, studying for 10 hours can be of lesser value than focused studying in a smarter manner for half that time.**The Plan to Make Failing a Thing of the Past:**Here is the basic plan that I recommend to get back on track so you never come close to failing again. This is something I initially developed for myself as I had a really tough time at the beginning of engineering school and was able to turn it around. I have further developed it by having other engineering students implement it as part of my mentoring program with them.So here are the primary items you need to address to get back on track . . .+ Continuity – Studying only for exams is a recipe for failure. Math and sciences in particular (but other subjects as well) are absorbed better when they are taken as smaller chunks on a regular basis. For me, this meant 15 minutes of problem solving at lunch and another 30-45 minutes later in the day even if there was no homework assignment. This was aside from my general work requirement and just kept me in the groove. Take some time to play around with different chunks of time for studying each day or each week. There is no specific time that works for everyone, but the idea of touching your material on a regular basis is key.+ Really UNDERSTAND the problems – Could you explain one of your practice problems to a non-engineer? Try working through each variable to be able to describe them in simple terms. If you can start to do this, you will have a better understanding of the problems and will also be able to spot the variables quicker.+ Study groups – Studying with others ends up helping on so many levels. There is the obvious side of things that they can explain things to you when you are having issues. However, there are two more reasons that these work well. First, when you explain things to others, you have to really focus on details. This will help you understand it better. Second, having to show up as part of the group and work with one another will help keep you accountable as you do not want to be seen by the group as a drag.+ Office hours – You pay to be at the university and one of the things they give you is professors to be your guide. Take advantage of the office hours they offer to get assistance. This will help you with the material and will also show the professor that you care. As an added bonus, this can help create a bond with the professor which is always great for networking purposes.+ Accountability – Have someone with whom you need to check in with on a regular basis and update them on your progress. No judgement, just honest feedback from them is enough to make sure you stay on top of your work. By the way, accountability can be provided by your study group partners as well. However, I have found that it is beneficial to separate these two roles and have an accountability partner outside of the study group. I believe this person is more likely to take a holistic approach to supporting you as opposed to the study partners that will focus strictly on the classes.+ Schedule down time – The biggest distraction to your studying is wanting some time off. If you schedule specific times to be on break, you can stay focused much longer by keeping in mind that it is only a certain period longer until you have that break.This is not an all or nothing game. You can pick the parts of my plan that work for you and implement them into your daily life over time. The key is to just pick something to change and start moving towards a better outcome in future semesters.Don't let one bad course ruin the rest of your studies and get you down.

I'm starting to get imposter syndrome because I really don't know what I'm doing at all in this class and I truly feel like I'm doing anything to connive my way to a 60% so I never encounter this material again in my life. Am I in the wrong career? I love coding. I just don't understand anything beyond the first couple of chapters of computational linear algebra."

In January 2020, I thought I would apply to jobs and start working in a couple of months. I wasn't under any illusions that the job search would be easy, I knew from other people that no matter how qualified you are there would probably be more rejections than offers. Basically because of some circumstances out of my control and stuff that happened in my life, I've been afraid to leave the house for the last couple of years. I've been depressed since I was 13 but the last few years I've reached depths of sadness and grief that I've never experienced before. I've stopped talking to any one at all outside of my family. I just lost touch with friends, the professors who supervised my master's and everyone. It's not like anyone else reached out either. It's been two years and other than one person, nobody has reached out to me at all. I don't blame any one for this, because as I know very well myself, everyone is busy with their own shit and their own struggles or happiness. I tried therapy when I was at school, but because of how my life is right now, it's not an option. To be honest, when I did go to therapy regularly it did not help whatsoever. Maybe I had a not good university therapist but she simply wasn't helpful. So now I need a job pretty desperately but my mental health is pretty bad.

I just have so much pain and grief in me that getting through the day is a struggle.

I got an 80 on that. Yesterday in class, he said there will be another retake for midterm 2, one that is worth 80% of lost points. Additionally, he mentioned more extra credit opportunities going forward worth at least a 6% boost to our overall average. I have one more exam to take in the class. No final.Now here's the thing, the audit/withdrawal deadline for all classes is this Friday, the 18th. I will not be able to submit the midterm 2 retake until the following Monday. I was a bit confused about that 6% extra credit, and so I am planning on talking to him about it during his office hours later today, as well as the prospect of dropping the class. This will also be relayed to my advisor, whom I will be speaking with tomorrow on how to move forward.For my degree program, I am required to get a C (70-79) or better in each class.

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit or using it even. But I just need a spot to rant. I'm a 2nd year (maybe 3rd year??? Not sure I'm a transfer student that switched majors so my credits are jumbled) engineering student majoring in mechanical engineering. I have had a good GPA and I'm typically a “good” student and was even on the honor roll the past two semester. But this semester is killer. I'm taking calculus 3, statics, and physics 3 and a seminar class. I started the semester off pretty strong and my grades were fine and I was chilling. Midterms came around and I studied my butt off. Physics was alright I would've failed without the curve but i got an 84%. Calculus tho? Got a 43/120. The class average was a 32/120. No curve. My grade's atrocious. My first statics midterm I did alright, got an 84%.Now I'm near the end of the semester. After those midterms it feels like a switch flicked in my brain. I started slacking hardddd on my work. I went through about 4 weeks of basically not doing my physics hw. I've been procrastinating on my statics lectures and I absolutely got destroyed on the last assignment. I've been super unmotivated since the midterm for math. Now I can't seem to find myself doing most work. I had a test this Monday for physics and I can't even stress how badly I failed that exam, I already know I did. I have a statics exam this Thursday and it's just now sinking in that I am not well informed. I have some crappy integral hw due for calc 3 this Friday and at this point I'm debating not doing it. I know most of this is on me. I'm not asking anyone to say otherwise I'm this rant. But idk. I'm just trying to find some relatability I suppose. Is anyone going through this? Or has anyone gone through this? How did it end up for you guys or what did you do to recover? I should probably add that I am only going to college due to scholarships and grants. I've calculated my GPA to see if I'm going to lose any and even talked to an advisor and I think I'm okay. But I can't help but feel like a failure or like a piece of crap. I feel like I failed my own standards and those of everyone around me. I can't help but feel unaccomplished and as if I'm destroying my future with internships while I'm at it.

Here is some quick backstory on my questionThis entire semester I have (surprising to myself even) maintained a 4.0 GPA with my hardest classes being Chem 1 and Calc 2. I have had a mid to high A in all of my classes except Calc 2 where it has remained around a 91% ever since exam one. Well, that changed with this last test I took and now I have a 89.3% in that class. I have the option to drop one of my tests throughout the year. I was planning to do that for the final so I could pretty much be done with my semester a few weeks early, but I was originally planning that for when I still had my A. Now, my situation has changed.So, my question is now do I work my ass off for the A that I may not even get (I'll need an 88% on an uncurved test to achieve this) or do I not even do any of my homework or labs and show up to lecture to get an 87% for the class. It is important to mention that even if I get 100% on the rest of my labs and homework, I'll remain below the magical 89.5%, meaning that I'll still get a B.I know many of you probably would simply say to take the final, but to me that means dedicating another 35 hours of studying on top of other assignments for a test that I could just as easily just end up with a B in the class. My mental health can't really take an L like wasting another 50 hours just to end up with the grade I would get by not doing anything for that class for the rest of the semester.Also, to mention, I would go from a 4.0 to a 3.75, which I know is still a very good grade, but it would just be awesome to say that I had one semester in Engineering where I had a 4.0.

I also get a steak dinner out of the deal if I get a 4.0 lol.TLDR: I can't decide if I should just keep my B in Calc 2 and do literally nothing the rest of the semester or work my ass off (probably 50 hours + worth of total time dedicated to the final and other homework) just for a mere chance of an A in that class and a semester GPA of a 4.0. â€‹Thanks for reading and your input!"

Maths doesn't come particularly easy to me, last year before doing my GCSEs I wasn't working at the entry requirement for the UTC I'm at now. Needing to get into this school is what motivated me, in the months leading up to my exams I did about 250 hours in total of revision for my GCSEs with about a quarter of that being for maths (the rest split between the other 8 subjects I was doing).

I'm currently at the school, enjoying the engineering courses, but finding A-level maths pretty hard.

Your major is hard. It doesn't matter the engineering discipline, everyone has a hard major. The things we do are not supposed to be easy. So don't get discouraged if you don't get the grade you wanted at the end of the year. I promise you it is not the end of the world. There was one particular class in my undergrad that I had to take three times because I couldn't get the grade I needed to pass and earn my degree. I finally did and now I work on rockets and large scale systems for a major international company. But in those previous two attempts to take that class, I couldn't be more discouraged. First time, I failed. I failed bad too, talking single digit score out of a 100. Second time I got a D and that still wasn't good enough. The third and final time, I finally squeezed an A out, which while at exciting, I was still beyond nervous because I never thought I'd get a job with an F on my transcript. But I learned in my job search that recruiters and companies cared more about how I responded to my previous failure than the fact that I failed. Don't let a single grade/semester define you, because you can still bounce back. The world isn't going to end just because you failed/didn't do well in a course. There are still ways to get into the career field. You're GPA is helpful for finding your first job, but even then it isn't the sole defining factor in finding a job. If a company exclusively looks at your GPA as what defines a good candidate then they have bad recruiting, simple as that. After your first job, your experience matters so much more. I had to take a different path and go into another engineering discipline to get my first job, but when it came time to find my next job (in my major) I used the leadership experience and applied the knowledge I gained in that job in order to make myself a more desirable candidate and it has worked out very well.Bottom line, if you get a bad grade this year, take a minute to reflect, get it out, and make a plan to correct it. Whether it's taking the class again, changing majors, visiting with an advisor, whatever it takes. If it's really got you down (first bad grade ever), talk to someone about it. We have all been there. None of us thought we would ever fail but we have. You will get through it.

It was discouraging but not the end of the world. There were a few course re-takes and many, MANY C's and guess what? I made or through and have so far had a career full of great learnings and am at a company at the top of my industry. Get your degree and the rest will be what you make of it, the grades won't matter.So don't feel discouraged by seeing lots of success posts, or talking to friends doing “better” than you. Enjoy your college days and just do your best.Alright that's all, good luck!"

Especially those studying outside of the US,"During my bachelors at an American university (UT Austin), for something like 80% of my engineering classes, we weren't required to memorize anything. We could bring an index card or a full sheet of paper with whatever we wanted written on it. This became standard policy the further along we got into the bachelors, and honestly, a lot of my studying became devoted to the exercise of making the cheat sheet itself - reviewing the lectures and assignments, deciding what to put on there, what to omit, etc. Most of the actual exam problems would *not* be a straightforward application of the formulas presented in class, and indeed, blindly copying everything from class onto the cheat sheet would not have helped you. Overall, I thought this approach was very reasonable, and became something I took for granted. Occasionally there were even open book exams, which were usually even harder.Then I decided to study for my masters in Europe - in France and Italy, specifically. And I'm absolutely appalled by how much the exams are based on memorization. At least in France, the professors had the decency to tell us which formulas to memorize and which would be provided, and the exam would be straightforward enough if you paid attention in class and did the tutorials. In Italy, on the other hand, *oh boy*. In the vast majority of cases, *nothing* is provided - you literally have to memorize every single formula and concept that the professor maybe explained just once in the entire semester, and be able to regurgitate it during the one exam that's your entire grade for the class. Never mind the fact that there's no homework, tutorials, or problem-solving sessions to actually apply the material and help you learn it better during the semester.It makes the exams artificially more difficult by an order of magnitude, and absolutely does *not* make you a better engineer in any way. So much time is wasted in trying to memorize everything, to the point where you have to resort to coming up with mnemonics to remember some things. And the questions on the exam tended to just be a rather straightforward application of maybe 15% of the overall course material, i.e. just plugging in values., or explaining a concept exactly the way the professor explained it in lecture. Little critical thinking necessary, but your ability to answer entirely hinges on your ability to recall that specific formula or concept. It's absolutely mind-boggling how anyone thinks this is genuinely an effective way to learn or evaluate things.So, for my American counterparts, was being allowed cheat sheets also the norm at your universities? For those who studied in other parts of the world, was this allowed as well?","Title: How much memorization was required in your engineering classes? Especially those studying outside of the US.

Because of this, I assumed that the entropy didn't remain constant between entering and exiting the turbine.

At some point during this semester, I've woken up each day of the week immediately thinking about what I need to do for classes, projects, or extracurricular activities, and it's been the most pressure I've encountered. On top of all that, I felt constant disappointment with my job search being either interviewed then ghosted, or ghosted from the get-go. I spent much of the semester doubting my own abilities and accomplishments.Nevertheless, I have finally something to show through all those hardship. Ended the semester getting all A's! (Including a few A-; I hate that some professors does this but it's still an A in my book). Last time I had these type of grades was first semester freshman year, right before COVID threw my whole academic world out of whack lol. With this semester, I was finally able to bump my overall GPA up to 3.7 which qualifies me for Magna Cum Laude during graduation which I'm happy about! So long I keep this GPA next semester I suppose.In terms of my job search, I was ready to delay my graduation one semester to take a co-op intern which would require me to work full-time, but at least it'll guarantee me a full-time position upon completion of the program and once I graduate. Honestly wasn't what I wanted to do, but I'd take whatever opportunity I can get at this point. But last minute, right before I went on break for the semester, I was contacted to conduct an interview with a large defense company for a Systems Engineer I position and eventually got an offer with them to my surprise! I'm so glad because this is honestly the best outcome and its the type of work I wanted to do and it won't delay my graduation. Anyways, I just feel so happy and wanted to share a bit of my success. I hope you all are also seeing some positive in your careers, but if not try and keep your head up and take whatever opportunities comes your way!

He said he didn't know and would get back to me, this did not happen. Furthermore, before officially turning in my project I sent all my files to him for review. This was not a cold call the prof. offered to review any files before we turned them in for grading, to which I also received no response. I want to be clear; I did not use files created by someone else's. I spent 20+ hours working on these files by myself. The methods and dimensioning I used in making my project were a combination of what I learned in my class and what I learned from the aforementioned tutorial. About 10 days before the deadline I spoke openly to the professor about the progress of my project, even going so far as to discuss helpful ""fun facts"" I had learned while watching the video with him. At no time was it made apparent or even eluded to that what I was doing or had done represented a form of academic misconduct. That being said, I received an email the other day from my professor stating that he has determined me to be guilty of academic misconduct and that he is filing a report of such with the school.

zz8ri9,1,1,1672427601,1673168818,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zz8ri9/a_guide_to_studying_engineering_mathematics/,A guide to studying engineering mathematics,"I will present a simple guide for studying mathematics in engineering school.Â Please note that this guide is intended for the study of rote mathematical methods in engineering school, NOT the organic study of pure math as an art and science.Â **TIME ALLOCATION**Â First of all, look at your class syllabus. What percentage of your grade is comprised of homework and assignments, and what percentage of your grade is comprised of exam grades? You should allocate your working hours with the same percentage split.Â A common setup in the US is that 80% of the grade is from exams, and 20% is from homework. Even if you get 100s on all the exams, if you don't do the homework assignments you'll only get an 80.0% in the class.Â Therefore however many hours you spend on the class, 80% of those hours should be spent practicing for exams, and 20% of those hours should be spent working on homework assignments. (Luckily, preparing for exams entails doing practice problems, and many of those practice problems on are on homework assignments.)Â From now on your homework assignments should be regarded as exam preparation, not as standalone projects with any inherent value. My recommendation is to treat the homeworks as studying practice, and then when you get to the end of your rope, simply ""creatively finish"" (i.e. look up the answers on Chegg) in order to hand in the homework on time. The real point of the class is to perform on the exam. Just use the homeworks as studying practice.Â You should also keep track of your time spent studying. A typical engineering student has 5 classes per week, and I would recommend spending 50 hours per week studying, yielding 10 hours per week per class, which can be adjusted based on which classes are easier vs. harder. Sometimes 60-90 hour weeks will be necessary, but you chose engineering, so don't complain, just prepare.Â What should you do during the 80% of hours you spend preparing for exams? Read on:Â **NOTE-TAKING VS. REFERENCE LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION**Â Many people are encouraged to take notes, but no one knows why, and most people's notes I've seen are terrible. Their notes are rushed, incoherent, and follow the train of thought of the lecturer without slowing down to cover misunderstandings or gaps in information. This is an inherent flaw with the Lecture model, but I digress.Â The purpose of note taking is actually to build up a Reference Library of personally-curated materials that you can look at later in order to remember information and methods. This means that GOOD notes are not necessarily linear, nor do they necessarily follow the order of the textbook or the order of the class. *Good notes follow the way your brain naturally organizes, sorts, and retrieves material.* This is different for everyone. In other words: your job as a note-taker is in fact to distill the information presented and lecture and the textbook into a personal mini-textbook organized in exactly the way that your brain works. (THIS is what 80% of your time spent studying engineering mathematics looks like--reviewing your notes and the textbook and slowly building a big index of shortcuts, definitions, tips, tricks, and practice problems that you can use later for test preparation.)Â I would recommend using a combination of OneNote, LaTeX, and Excel to store your notes, because then they'll be searchable. It's easier to search ""Bernoulli"" in OneNote than it is to look it up in a 350-page physical textbook.Â What actually goes into a Personal Reference Library? Read on:Â **DECONSTRUCTING A MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT**Â Let's say you come across a new **equation**, one that's presented in class. Before being able to really use the equation to its full potential, you must be able to answer the following questions about the equation:Â - When was this equation first derived?- Who derived it?- Why did they derive it?- How long did it take them to derive it?- What was the equation used for when it was first derived?- What is the equation used for today?- What variables are present in the equation?- What are the SI units of each of the variables?- What is the meaning in English of each of the variables?- What script do each of the variables come from? (Latin? Greek? Custom?)Â Don't even bother trying to use an equation to solve problems unless you have first deconstructed the equation in this manner! All of this information for every equation you come across should be neatly tucked away in your Personal Reference Library, easily searchable by you. I would make a template for deconstructing equations that you can clone each time you meet a new equation.Â The great thing about this method is that it's not even slightly difficult! There's no abstract processing! You just look in your textbook, Wikipedia, and YouTube to find the information, and store it. And it counts as studying! If it takes you 45 minutes to deconstruct an equation in this manner, you just studied for 45 minutes, and you were on autopilot the whole time!Â If you come across a **word** you don't understand, then you should write down its definition in your Personal Reference Library. Then, when you come across the word again, don't go to the internet to find its definition, go to your Personal Reference Library, where you wrote the word's official definition AND a definition in words that make sense to you. In fact, why not go to Office Hours and review your Word List with the TA to make sure that you've rephrased everything correctly? Say, that's another 2 hours of studying you just did, and it wasn't even stressful!Â Well, what about actually using these mathematical concepts in practice? Read on:Â **TRYING PRACTICE PROBLEMS**Â Now that you have manually written down a bunch of information about the words, methods, variables, and equations in your Personal Reference Library, it's time to use your PRL to solve practice problems. Time to look at your homework assignments. By the time the exam rolls around, you should be able to answer the following questions:Â - How many practice problems were given on the homeworks?- What was the difficulty level of each of the practice problems?- What equations or concepts were covered in each problem?- How many practice problems did you attempt?- How many practice problems are you able to solve without help?- How many practice problems were available in the textbook?Â These questions are of course easy for you to answer, because you're storing each of the practice problems that you were assigned in your Personal Reference Library, labelling them for the concepts they review, and re-trying them over and over again until you can solve them without assistance. In fact, why not give a Name to each practice problem so that you can go back and reference it as soon as you think of it (like ""Forces on a Spring on a Rolling Platform"" or ""Inverse Matrix Multiplication With Variables Instead of Numbers""). You have the solutions saved as well, right? Aha, that's another 5 hours of studying per week, and you're just repeating actions that you already know how to do. In fact, if someone says something like ""matrix multiplication"", you should be able to remember that you've had 19 Matrix Multiplication questions assigned since the beginning of class, and you should be able to access them all with two or three clicks. After all, you're saving all PDFs and scans of homework solutions in your Personal Reference Library.Â As a matter of fact, if you ever get ahead on the homework assignments, why not pop open the textbook and attempt some of the unassigned practice problems, too? What's the stress? Those problems weren't even assigned. Why not get your friends together, have a beer, and try random practice problems from the textbook while someone else looks at the answer on Chegg and steers the attempter with tips based on the solution?Â Don't even worry about solving new problems. If you're stuck for longer than 5 minutes on a new problem, what's the point of wasting time trying to flog your brain into magically solving it? Just look at the solution. What's a better use of 3 hours, solving one problem you don't understand, or solving 10 problems over and over again with the help of a solution guide so you're exposed to many different problems and possible methods of solving them?Â Speaking of possible methods of solving problems, how exactly does the textbook know to make a certain type of trick at the right time? There's no way you personally would guess that! Read on:Â **VOLUME OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS**Â When I was a young engineering student, I would fight with a problem for thirty minutes, finally give in and look at the solution method, and become furious when the textbook author said something like ""recognize that a u-substitution can be made"". How the hell was I supposed to think of that?Â Well, it turns out that the difference between math whizzes and math dorks is a matter of repetition, not necessarily a matter of cleverness (although that is also important). Math whizzes have solved so many problems over and over again that they remember little tricks from other problems that they can recycle. I had maybe solved 30 u-substitution problems by the time I was working on the assignment, but the textbook writer had solved more like 500! Of course the trick appears easily to him--in a similar fashion, when I'm playing defense in soccer, and the ball suddenly flies way up in the air, I know where to run to contact it, because I've seen the ball fly up in the air hundreds of times. If I approached soccer the same way I used to approach math, I would have walked onto the soccer field for the first time, watched the ball fly up in the air, and then become furious because I didn't know which way to run!Â The only shortcut an inexperienced rote learner can take is to have a literal list of ""methods to try"". As an example, when you come across a tough integral, you can have a list of questions like:Â - Is the integral of a common form that has a quick, memorizable solution?- Can I solve this with the basic laws of integrations?- Can I rewrite the equation as a combination of integrals?- Can I made a u-substitution?- Can I make a trigonometric substitution?- ...Â It's like having a troubleshooting guide for a software program, except it's a troubleshooting guide for math problems. You should write multiple guides for different types of problems you come across, and these guides should be in your Personal Reference Library, and you should reference them every time you solve a new problem. This will get you in the habit of having a plan of attack when you encounter difficult new problems.Â Learning only works with the reinforcement from repetition. It's not like Pokemon, where once you encounter a skill you've ""learned it"" and can always use it perfectly in any context. When you encounter and solve a problem, the solution is in your head for maybe 20 minutes, and then you start to forget it. You need to do it over and over again, over multiple days so you can sleep in between, and each time it should get easier and easier.Â Now that you have a giant Personal Reference Library with deconstructed methods, derivations, and word definitions, a huge database of practice problems and their solutions, and a plan of attack for encountering new materials and problems, you should make a formal preparation for the exam. Read on:Â **PREPARING FOR THE EXAM**Â It's two or three weeks before the exam! You should be able to answer the following questions about the exam:Â - When is the exam?- What chapters or concepts are covered in the exam?- How difficult are this professor's exams?- What is the historical average exam grade in the class?- How comfortable are you with the material?Â Remember, you shouldn't need to cram, because 80% of your time spent interfacing with the class has been practicing for the exam, so you should already have a nicely organized, distilled Personal Reference Library to supplement for studying. Assuming you can answer those major questions about the exam, you should also be able to make a list of:Â - All the equations in the chapters that the exam covers (you deconstructed them all in your PRL, right?)- All of the practice problems that you performed in prior preparation for the exam (you named them all and put them in your PRL, right?)- All of the words you had to learn in the course of studying for the exam (you listed them all, their definitions, and your re-definitions in your PRL, right?)Â Once you have this list, you can make your Cheat Sheet! Spend 5-10 hours copying down all of the information to a cheat sheet, and then take 5-10 ""practice exams"" using only your cheat sheet as a reference guide. If you don't have access to any practice exams, pick a few medium-hard problems that you've never seen before (that you have the solutions to), the hardest problems from your homework, make them into an informal exam, and then time yourself solving it. You can do it with your friends if you feel lonely. Then grade your performance, review the solutions, drill the problems over and over again until you can solve them without help, and then bolster your Personal Reference Library with whatever information you were missing.Â Say, your friends are around, aren't they? Why not take turns teaching practice problems and concepts to each other? Teaching is by far the best way to reinforce your knowledge of a concept.Â What about actually maximizing your grade? Read on:Â **HOW TO GET A GOOD GRADE**Â If you're already getting a good grade, your method is working fine and you don't need to change it. Otherwise...Â It's surprising when someone gets a good grade when they...Â - Don't have a Personal Reference Library- Don't carefully read the textbook- Don't go to Office Hours every week- Don't study with their friends- Don't retake classes they failed- Don't return to basic concepts that they don't quite understand- Aren't studying at least 6 hours per week- Aren't sleeping well at night- Aren't exercising at least 4 times per week- Are drinking or using drugs oftenÂ **FINAL STATEMENT**Â I hope you enjoy this guide. I NEVER studied like this in college, except for one class my sophomore year. I got an un-curved 98% in the class... the class average was an un-curved 68%. My GPA was otherwise unremarkable. Best of luck to all engineering students and may your exams be blessed with lenient curves and your professors be on the verge of retirement.","Title: A guide to studying engineering mathematics.

You have the solutions saved as well, right? Aha, that's another 5 hours of studying per week, and you're just repeating actions that you already know how to do. In fact, if someone says something like ""matrix multiplication"", you should be able to remember that you've had 19 Matrix Multiplication questions assigned since the beginning of class, and you should be able to access them all with two or three clicks. After all, you're saving all PDFs and scans of homework solutions in your Personal Reference Library.Â As a matter of fact, if you ever get ahead on the homework assignments, why not pop open the textbook and attempt some of the unassigned practice problems, too? What's the stress? Those problems weren't even assigned. Why not get your friends together, have a beer, and try random practice problems from the textbook while someone else looks at the answer on Chegg and steers the attempter with tips based on the solution?Â Don't even worry about solving new problems. If you're stuck for longer than 5 minutes on a new problem, what's the point of wasting time trying to flog your brain into magically solving it? Just look at the solution. What's a better use of 3 hours, solving one problem you don't understand, or solving 10 problems over and over again with the help of a solution guide so you're exposed to many different problems and possible methods of solving them?Â Speaking of possible methods of solving problems, how exactly does the textbook know to make a certain type of trick at the right time? There's no way you personally would guess that! Read on:Â **VOLUME OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS**Â When I was a young engineering student, I would fight with a problem for thirty minutes, finally give in and look at the solution method, and become furious when the textbook author said something like ""recognize that a u-substitution can be made"". How the hell was I supposed to think of that?Â Well, it turns out that the difference between math whizzes and math dorks is a matter of repetition, not necessarily a matter of cleverness (although that is also important). Math whizzes have solved so many problems over and over again that they remember little tricks from other problems that they can recycle. I had maybe solved 30 u-substitution problems by the time I was working on the assignment, but the textbook writer had solved more like 500! Of course the trick appears easily to him--in a similar fashion, when I'm playing defense in soccer, and the ball suddenly flies way up in the air, I know where to run to contact it, because I've seen the ball fly up in the air hundreds of times. If I approached soccer the same way I used to approach math, I would have walked onto the soccer field for the first time, watched the ball fly up in the air, and then become furious because I didn't know which way to run!Â The only shortcut an inexperienced rote learner can take is to have a literal list of ""methods to try"". As an example, when you come across a tough integral, you can have a list of questions like:Â - Is the integral of a common form that has a quick, memorizable solution?- Can I solve this with the basic laws of integrations?- Can I rewrite the equation as a combination of integrals?- Can I made a u-substitution?- Can I make a trigonometric substitution?- ...Â It's like having a troubleshooting guide for a software program, except it's a troubleshooting guide for math problems. You should write multiple guides for different types of problems you come across, and these guides should be in your Personal Reference Library, and you should reference them every time you solve a new problem. This will get you in the habit of having a plan of attack when you encounter difficult new problems.Â Learning only works with the reinforcement from repetition. It's not like Pokemon, where once you encounter a skill you've ""learned it"" and can always use it perfectly in any context. When you encounter and solve a problem, the solution is in your head for maybe 20 minutes, and then you start to forget it. You need to do it over and over again, over multiple days so you can sleep in between, and each time it should get easier and easier.Â Now that you have a giant Personal Reference Library with deconstructed methods, derivations, and word definitions, a huge database of practice problems and their solutions, and a plan of attack for encountering new materials and problems, you should make a formal preparation for the exam. Read on:Â **PREPARING FOR THE EXAM**Â It's two or three weeks before the exam! You should be able to answer the following questions about the exam:Â - When is the exam?- What chapters or concepts are covered in the exam?- How difficult are this professor's exams?- What is the historical average exam grade in the class?- How comfortable are you with the material?Â Remember, you shouldn't need to cram, because 80% of your time spent interfacing with the class has been practicing for the exam, so you should already have a nicely organized, distilled Personal Reference Library to supplement for studying. Assuming you can answer those major questions about the exam, you should also be able to make a list of:Â - All the equations in the chapters that the exam covers (you deconstructed them all in your PRL, right?)- All of the practice problems that you performed in prior preparation for the exam (you named them all and put them in your PRL, right?)- All of the words you had to learn in the course of studying for the exam (you listed them all, their definitions, and your re-definitions in your PRL, right?)Â Once you have this list, you can make your Cheat Sheet! Spend 5-10 hours copying down all of the information to a cheat sheet, and then take 5-10 ""practice exams"" using only your cheat sheet as a reference guide. If you don't have access to any practice exams, pick a few medium-hard problems that you've never seen before (that you have the solutions to), the hardest problems from your homework, make them into an informal exam, and then time yourself solving it. You can do it with your friends if you feel lonely. Then grade your performance, review the solutions, drill the problems over and over again until you can solve them without help, and then bolster your Personal Reference Library with whatever information you were missing.Â Say, your friends are around, aren't they? Why not take turns teaching practice problems and concepts to each other? Teaching is by far the best way to reinforce your knowledge of a concept.Â What about actually maximizing your grade? Read on:Â **HOW TO GET A GOOD GRADE**Â If you're already getting a good grade, your method is working fine and you don't need to change it. Otherwise...Â It's surprising when someone gets a good grade when they...Â - Don't have a Personal Reference Library- Don't carefully read the textbook- Don't go to Office Hours every week- Don't study with their friends- Don't retake classes they failed- Don't return to basic concepts that they don't quite understand- Aren't studying at least 6 hours per week- Aren't sleeping well at night- Aren't exercising at least 4 times per week- Are drinking or using drugs oftenÂ **FINAL STATEMENT**Â I hope you enjoy this guide. I NEVER studied like this in college, except for one class my sophomore year. I got an un-curved 98% in the class... the class average was an un-curved 68%. My GPA was otherwise unremarkable. Best of luck to all engineering students and may your exams be blessed with lenient curves and your professors be on the verge of retirement."

So let me explain how I got into this situation. This is actually my 4th year in college and the first and second years I mostly fucked around, not knowing what I wanted to major in, getting bad grades and whatnot, almost getting kicked our of college at one point. At my college you need to complete 8 first year engineering courses to be accepted into the engineering department, and they only look at those 8 grades for admission, hence how I was able to get into the electrical department despite a lackluster gpa. I withdrew from a lot of courses as I always struggled with some concepts in alot of classes however I know I can pass engineering as I survived calculus 2, chem, and thermodynamics. Plus this is my dream career path so quitting is not an option. Im looking at completing my degree in at least 5 or 6 more years meaning I will spend at least 9 years in college to finish a 4 year degree. The questions I ask is if anyone has ever been in this situation, and how did you manage to pass? Do I even have any hope for an internship and will I even be hired after college with how long I spent in college? Im very worried for my future. Also if anyone was wondering how I was able to afford wasting all this time I was lucky because of a scholarship amd bursaries since im poor and a minority but even that will run out and I will be forced to take loans so I basically squandered that opportunity.","Title: Took 3 Years to Complete my First Year in Electrical Engineering.
