"I'll address each of the concerns raised in these posts.

**Post 1: Academic Integrity**

The student used an online tutorial to help with a project in CAD software, disclosing this use to their professor beforehand. The professor now claims plagiarism, despite initial approval for using the tutorial. This is a tricky situation. To contest the outcome, I'd recommend:

*   Keeping a detailed record of all interactions with the professor regarding the tutorial and citing its use.
*   Reviewing the school's academic integrity policies to understand what constitutes plagiarism in this context.
*   Speaking with the department chair or another faculty member to clarify the professor's actions and potential consequences.

**Post 2: Feeling Overwhelmed**

The student is struggling with Diffeq and statics, feeling like they should be doing better. This is a common phenomenon. To cope:

*   Focus on understanding concepts rather than trying to memorize formulas.
*   Seek help from classmates, tutors, or online resources when needed.
*   Break down study sessions into manageable chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

**Post 3: Considering Major Changes**

The student wants to change majors due to struggling with engineering classes. Before making a decision:

*   Reflect on why they chose engineering as a major in the first place.
*   Research other majors that align with their interests and strengths.
*   Discuss concerns with academic advisors or mentors to explore options.

**Post 4: GPA Requirements**

The student has been offered an internship with a stipulation of maintaining a 3.0 GPA, despite initially being told it was preferred but not required. This is a situation where communication with the recruiter might be helpful:

*   Review the offer letter and clarify any doubts with the recruiter.
*   Discuss potential consequences of not meeting the GPA requirement.
*   Consider requesting a guarantee or clarification on how this stipulation will be enforced.

These are general suggestions, and each situation may require more specific advice."
